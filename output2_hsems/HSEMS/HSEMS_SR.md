# HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

The Company Management recognises the necessity and responsibility, not only to provide competent personnel and well-maintained vessels, but also to promote amongst people working for or on behalf of the company a high standard of safety, health and hygiene and environmental awareness and commitment. It is the Company Management's belief that such awareness and commitment which includes pro-active attitudes towards HSE issues, must start and transcend from the most senior management level downwards through the whole spectrum of the organisation, including shipboard and shore based personnel.

In formulating the HSE Policy, the Company Management has identified clearly the objectives and commitment that are required.

The main objectives of the HSE Policy are appended below which are applicable to all people working for or on behalf of the company.

To develop and implement HSE Management procedures

To continuously maintain, review and improve upon the HSEQ IMS and HSE performance

To prevent pollution and to set objectives and targets to reduce environmental impact

To achieve "Zero Pollution Incidents" on our vessels

To ensure full compliance with the requirements of all mandatory rules and regulations

To ensure compliance with applicable codes, guidelines and standards recommended by the IMO, ILO,

Flag State and local Legislation, Classification Societies and Maritime Industry.

The Company Management has therefore endorsed a comprehensive HSEQ Integrated Management System Manual (IMS) that clearly identifies in detail the procedures and measures required to achieve these objectives. The IMS Manual also stresses the importance of giving a high priority and compliance to clients own rules, regulations and standards.

This IMS Manual will be kept under constant revised accordingly in line with newichanged regulations, Company initiatives and to meet or exceed Client expectations.

# NAVIGATION POLICY

The Company Management recognises the necessity and responsibility, not only to provide competent personnel and well-maintained vessels, but also to promote amongst its employees, a high standard for navigation safety, awareness and commitment. It is the Company Management's belief that such awareness and commitment which includes pro-active attitudes towards Navigation matters, must start and transcend from the Company management through the Master of the Bridge Watch Keeping Team.

In formulating the Navigation Policy, the Company Management has identified clearly the objectives and commitment that are required.

The main objectives of the Navigation Policy are appended below which are applicable to all Bridge Watch keeping team members in our fleet.

At all times when the vessel is at sea or at anchor, the Bridge Watch must be under the control of a responsible, licensed Officer of the Watch (OOW).

The Master or OOW must not leave the Bridge unless properly relieved:

- a) in periods of restricted visibility
- when there is heavy traffic in the vicinfly of the vessel b)
- while underway in restricted waters, inside 500m zone or DP mode c)
- during heavy weather conditions d)
- when entering or leaving port, docking, undocking, shifting the vessel, entering or leaving e) e the 500m zone, when the vessel is in DP mode
- during Ship to Ship Manoeuvring f)
- when embarking or disembarking a Pilot or Mooring Master g)
- when anchoring or weighing anchor, mooring operations h)
- during helicopter operations on the vessel i)
- at any other time when the Master judges conditions to be a potential threat to the i) vessel's safety

The Company Management has therefore endorsed complete and comprehensive procedures that clearly identify in detail the procedures and measures required to achieve the above objectives. The procedures also stress the importance of giving a high priority to and compliance with clients own navigation safety rules, regulations and standards, where applicable.

These procedures will be kept under constant revised accordingly in line with new/changed requlations, initiatives and to meet or exceed Client expectations.

# SECURITY POLICY

The Company Management recognises the necessity and responsibility to, as far as is reasonably practicable, provide a secure working environment for its employees.

It is the Company Management's belief that such awareness and commitment which includes pro-active attitudes towards Security issues, must start and transcend from the most senior management level downwards through the whole spectrum of the organisation.

In formulating this Security Policy, the Company Management has developed and implemented appropriate Shipboard Security Plans and a Port Facility Security Plan in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the ISPS Code.

For vessels that are not required to comply with the requirements of the ISPS Code, security related procedures and instructions are developed and implemented accordingly.

Project specific security procedures may also be developed and implemented as may be required by the Project opedity boomy prever to address security concerns relating to that particular Project.

All such security procedures must remain confidential and only their requirements made available to the appropriate personnel in order to ensure their compliance.

#### 3 TOOLBOX TALK

- Toolbox Talks should be considered as a job briefing and is a forum for the supervisor and/or 3.1 person in charge of a job to ensure that the personnel carrying out the work fully understand the job requirements and they are reminded of the hazards involved, the procedures to be used and the precautions to be taken, as identified in the risk assessment.
- 3.2 A Toolbox Talk should be conducted prior to every task, irrespective of whether it is routine or non-routine and the Form in Appendix of this procedure is to be completed and retained on board.
- 3.3 Toolbox Talks shall be carried out on daily basis by the Master/Chief Officer & Chief/Second Engineer while delegating daily jobs to deck & engine room staff.
- 3.4 include all personnel that will be involved in the work and be of sufficient length and detail to ensure the objectives of the Toolbox Talk are met.
- 3.5 When the job scope changes or when there are new jobs added during the day, a fresh Tool box meeting should be carried out to cover all associated hazards

#### ਹ RISK ASSESMENT

#### 4.1 APPLICATION

- 4.1.1 During the course of various work activities performed on board the vessel, sea staff may be exposed to different types of hazards. All such hazardous situations possess a certain level or degree of risk.
- 4.1.2 In addition to potential safety and/or health hazards, some operational activities may also be potentially hazardous to the environment or to equipment/assets resulting in downtime and charter impact. These hazards must therefore be identified and risk assessed and control measures implemented.
- 4.1.3 The ability to identify and describe a hazard correctly and accurately is of utmost importance. If there is more than one possible cause of a hazardous occurrence at the work site, then all the hazards shall be clearly identification of hazards enables proper evaluation of existing controls and mitigating or preventive measures.
- 4.1.4 For each identified hazard the associated risks with regard to Health & Safety, Operations, Environmental and Charter Impact must be assessed.

#### RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY 4.2

- 4.2.1 Risk is the potential that a chosen action or activity (including the choice of inaction) will lead to a loss (an undesirable outcome).
- 4.2.2 Risk Assessment is a process of identifying the hazard, evaluating the risk considering the effectiveness of existing controls and deciding whether or not the risk is acceptable.
- 4.2.3 Generic Risk Assessment is the risk assessment which is a process followed by the shore management for the operational requirements of a specific project or charter, permit to work system.
- 4.2.4 Ship Specific Risk Assessment is a process carried out by ship staff on board the vessel, records of which are maintained on board.
- 4.2.5 A Hazard is a situation that poses a level of threat to life, health, property, or the environment.

- 4.2.6 Risk assessment addresses two elements, Probability (Likelihood) and Severity (Harmfulness).
- 4.2.7 Risk Assessment must be conducted for the work activity as a whole taking into account each sub activity, thereby ensuring the risk assessment participants focus objectively on specific tasks.
- 4.2.8 If two or more activities are to be carried out simultaneously (SIMOPS), when carrying out the risk assessments for each activity consideration must be given as to how each of the activities may present a hazard to or have an impact upon the other activities.
- 4.2.9 The use of the risk assessment technique affords the ability to categorise risk by severity or degree of seriousness. It provides the tools and the mechanism with which to categorise from "Low Risk" through to "High Risk", thus enabling focus on finding ways and means to eliminate or reduce the risk to "As Low As Reasonably Practicable" (ALARP).
- 4.2.10 ALARP is a level of risk that is acceptable by the management having regard to its legal obligations to safety of life, health and the environment.
- 4.2.11 A summary of the existing hazards, risks and control measures is to be carried out for any planned work activity to determine if existing controls to reduce the risk are in place and are adequate, which will determine its initial risk. If, because of the circumstances, significant additional hazards and risks for the planned work activity are identified that are not addressed by the existing control measures, then additional control measures are to be introduced to reduce the risk to ALARP level. Control measures should not be such which generate new hazards.

4.2.18 Depending on the risk category, steps must be taken to mitigate the risk to a level deemed to be acceptable, to bring the residual risk to green zone (between1-4) for safe operations. The steps to be taken must be assigned to appropriate individuals/personnel as "Action Items" and followed up by the Master / person in charge until they have been fully implemented.

# 4 2.19 Risk Reduction Method

The accepted method of risk reduction strategy takes the following proposals in descending order of preference:

- a) Elimination: Total risk elimination is the ideal solution. In most cases this is impractical but could be possible by re-configuring the work in a different way
- b) Substitution: Substitution of the work or process with a less hazardous one is a very good method of risk reduction. It may be particularly applied to the use of hazardous substances. Inevitably there will be a cost consideration to be taken into account.
- d) Engineering Controls: Introduction of engineering controls such as sound proofing, machinery guards, or exhaust ventilation to remove vapours and dust particles are very acceptable reduction methods.
- e) Administrative Controls: Administrative controls are changes to the way people work. Examples of administrative controls include procedure changes, employee training, and installation of signs and warning labels. Administrative controls do not remove hazards, but limit or prevent people's exposure to the hazards, such as cargo operation during day time during rough weather and strong current.
- f) Personal Protective Equipment: All personnel must adhere to PPE policy and shall wear adequate PPE suitable for the nature of work being carried out. Additional PPE requirement based on RA should be discussed during Tool Box meeting. PPE is the least effective means of controlling hazards because of the high potential for damage to render PPE ineffective, Additionally, some PPE, such as BA sets, increase physiological effort to complete a task,

![](_page_101_Figure_10.jpeg)

- 4.2.20 If it is not possible to reduce the risks to an acceptable level, the work should not be started or continued (STOP Work Policy) and the Company Management consulted.
- 4.2.21 Risk Assessment is qualitative in nature but can be further strengthened using quantitative information such as accident / injury statistics and other historical information.
- 4.2.22 Significant risks are risks which affect legal compliance or those risks which have a residual risk of "Very High" shall be termed as significant. The aspects / impacts associated with these risks shall also be termed as significant.
- 4.2.23 For Charters, it may be necessary to carry out a "Project Risk Assessment", which is intended to be a careful examination of what, in the nature of the planned operations, could put personnel, the vessel, equipment, the environment or the Project itself at risk. Such risks must include any potential health risks upon personnel as well as physical risks. Project Risk Assessments normally involve the operations personnel and ship's personnel and highlight whether enough precautions have been taken or more should be done to ensure the Project can he carried out at minimal risk

{102}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_102_Picture_0.jpeg)

- 4.2.24 A TOOLBOX TALK has to be carried out as part of all risk assessments and the staff involved must participate with a positive frame of mind towards risk reduction (Appendix B).
- 4.2.25 Whenever there is a deviation from original plan, a new Toolbox Talk and a review of the risk assessment has to be carried out thoroughly until it is safe to resume the operation, (see Management of Change and Appendix J). The risk assessment for a change in plan due to any unforeseen circumstances should be incorporated while carrying out a toolbox talk prior to the recommencement of the operation.

# 4.3 RISK ASSESSMENT FOR PERMIT TO WORK (PTW) PROCESSES

- 4.3.1 Risk Assessment becomes an integral part of all Permits to Work processes on board as outlined below. All risk assessments must be performed or carried out prior to any work activities as deemed appropriate by the Master or person in charge of the work activity.
- 4.3.2 Permit to work processes for which risk assessment shall be carried out are but not limited to:
  - a. Hot work activity on board.
  - Entry into enclosed spaces. b.
  - Electrical work that involves maintenance work on any electrical equipment or electrically C. powered system.
  - d. Working aloft or working over side.
  - Lock out / Tag out permits for work that requires control of all equipments having e. mechanical, stored pressure, chemical or electrical energy dormant within the system,
  - f. Underwater diving near to or under own vessel.
  - For any other activity on board the vessel which in the opinion of the Master or Chief g. Engineer possess health and safety risk to personnel, safety of vessel and/or to the environment.
  - For any other work activity defined in a management of change plan. ﮯ
  - For work activities carried out in offshore locations, dry docks or when the vessel is ﻨﺘ undergoing repairs being carried out by 3<sup>rd</sup> party contractors.
- 4.3.3 All records of risk assessment shall be maintained on board a period of 2 years. In case of any incident, accident or near miss, details of the risk assessment prior to the work activity being performed may need to be sighted by the investigator, flag or port state inspectors, Charter's representative, Technical Superintendents, internal and external auditors to verify that appropriate risk assessments were carried out prior to conduct of the work activity.

# 4.4 REVIEW AND REPORTING OF RISK ASSESSMENT, HAZARD IDENTIFICATION & CONTROLS

- 4.4.1 All risk assessments performed, hazards identified and any controls introduced over and above the existing procedures shall be discussed, highlighted, reviewed and recorded as part of the monthly HSE meeting on board the vessel.
- 4.4.2 Any feedback and suggestion requiring change in procedures or additional control to miligate hazards shall be communicated to HSE dept.

#### 5.0 PERMIT TO WORK (PTW)

#### 5.1 OPERATIONS REQUIRING A PTW

There are a number of operations onboard which involve an element of obvious risk:

- Hot Work any work involving the use of Welding equipment, Flame a. Cutting/Welding/Brazing equipment, Abrasive Grinders/Cutters/Brushes, Drilling equipment or any other equipment which uses open flames or generates heat or sparks that could be a source of ignition.
- Enclosed Space Entry full or partial entry of any personnel into any enclosed space. ﻔ
- Electrical Work - maintenance work on any item of electrical equipment or electrically powered system.
- Working at Height / Over side any type of work more than 2 metres above the deck ರ. and/or any type of above - water work outboard of the ship's side.
- e. Mechanical / Electrical Lockout / Tag out work any work that requires control of all electrical, mechanical or chemical energy.
- Diving Work any work involving diving near to or under the vessel. f.

C

g. Others - any other type of work that may have hazards and therefore risks to personnel in doing the work.

#### PTW CHECKLISTS 5.2

The PTW system consists of an organised and pre-defined checklist (see Appendices). A PTW does not in itself make the job safe, but contributes to a safe working environment.

#### 53 PTW PRINCIPLES

In using a PTW, the following principles apply:

- The PTW should include the completion of a Risk Assessment (JSA) &Toolbox Talk. a.
- The PTW should be as relevant and accurate as possible. It should state the locations ﺿ and details of the work to be done, the nature and results of any preliminary tests undertaken, the measures undertaken to make the job safe and safeguards that need to be taken during the operation.
- The PTW should specify the period of its validity (which should not exceed 12 hours) and C. any time limits applicable to the work, which it authorises.
- d. Only the work specified on the PTW should be undertaken.
- e. Before signing the PTW, the authorising officer should ensure that all measures specified as necessary have in fact been taken.
- f. If work is to be carried out that has a particularly high risk (such as hot work in identified hazardous areas), then the Master must seek Management approval for the PTW.
- If there is any doubt as to whether the job should proceed or not, the Master should g. consult and seek Management approval from the relevant Technical Superintendent, copied to the HSEQA Department. Examples of jobs that may require Management approval may include but not be limited to the following :
  - Planned Hot Work in a hazardous area, such as in a fuel tank. 1.
  - Work being carried out on critical machinery. ii.

{105}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_105_Picture_0.jpeg)

- iii .. Working at height or over side in rough weather.
- iv. Maintenance on overboard valves or suctions.
- V. Enclosed space entry
- The authorising officer retains the responsibility for the work until he has either cancelled ﮯ the PTW or formally transferred it to another authorised person who should be made fully conversant with the situation. Anyone who takes over, either as a matter of routine or in an emergency, from the authorising officer should sign the PTW to indicate transfer of full responsibility.
- . The person-in-charge or person responsible for carrying out the specific work should countersign the PTW to indicate his understanding of the safety precautions to be observed
- Upon completion of the work, the job site must be returned to its normal condition and j. the Job Completion section of the PTW signed off accordingly.
- When the vessel is internally audited, checks to ensure compliance with the PTW k. Systems will be included
- l. When an approved contractor (eg. during drydock) is carrying out work which requires PTW and does not involve any of ship staff and if the contractors are using their own format of PTW checklist, then the ship staff does not have to make a separate PTW for the same task.

# 5.4 PTW AUDIT AND MONITORING PROCESS

- a Active monitoring of the Permit-to-Work system provides essential feedback on performance before an accident, ill health or an incident. It involves checking compliance with performance standards and the achievement of specific objectives.
- b. The responsibility for monitoring rests with Master/OlM although the authority to monitor will be delegated to head of departments and/or the safety officer.
- c. A PTW system audit shall be carried out during regular internal audit and vessel inspection by shore management, all PTW checklists, tool box talk and associated risk assessments should be closely checked.
- d. During the process of PTW, the Master and Safety Officer of the vessel shall also conduct checks and audit on the effective implementation of the PTW process.
- e. In addition, Master and Safety Officer shall ensure that PTW process has been closed as per the checklist.
- f. PTW audit process and results found during audit including any gaps and non conformities shall be discussed during monthly HSE meeting.

# 5.5 ENCLOSED SPACE SAFE PRACTICE

- 5.5.1 Enclosed Space means a space that has any of the following characteristics :
  - a. Where ready access or egress for removal of disabled persons or equipment is difficult due to the location, limited size of the openings for entry and exit.
  - b. Where existing natural ventilation is insufficient to remove dangerous air concentrations and / or oxygen deficiency may exist or develop.
  - Where a space is not designed for continuous worker occupancy. ்.

{106}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_106_Picture_0.jpeg)

- 5.5.2 Spaces on board that are designated as enclosed spaces include but are not limited to
  - Cargo Tanks a.
  - Ballast Tanks b.
  - C Double bottom tanks
  - Cofferdams d.
  - e. Void Spaces
  - f. Chain Lockers
  - Fuel oil, Lube oil, sewage tanks g.
  - Any other space considered to be confined h.
- 5.5.3 The Master shall be the Responsible Person for all entries into an enclosed space. The Chief Officer and Chief Engineer respectively shall be deemed to be the Competent Person to make an assessment of the likelihood of a dangerous atmosphere being present or subsequently arising in the space.
- 5.5.4 It must be remembered that enclosed spaces that have not been opened for a long time may have an oxygen deficient atmosphere in them (due to steel oxidisation) and must be considered as hazardous, even if they have not previously contained hazardous materials.
- 5.5.5 Entry into an enclosed space has a greater likelihood of causing fatalities, severe injuries and illness than any other type of work on board the vessel
- 5.5.6 The key hazards associated with enclosed spaces are:
  - Loss of consciousness from asphyxiation arising from gas, fumes, vapour or lack of a. oxygen.
  - Serious risk of fire or explosion. b.
  - Loss of consciousness arising from an increase in body temperature. C.
  - Drowning arising from increased water level. d.
  - Inability to reach a breathable atmosphere due to entrapment. e.
- 5.5.7 Crews will have to enter into enclosed spaces that are difficult to access in the course of routine inspections or maintenance. There may be physical constraints due to small or narrow openings and the space itself maybe cramped, all of which may reduce mobility and must be taken into consideration.
- 5.5.8 Due to the (usually) unlit nature of enclosed space, ideally no entry to the space must be made by personnel who suffer from claustrophobia, panic or anxiety attacks.

# 5.6 ENCLOSED SPACE - SAFE ENTRY POLICY

- 5.6.1 I is the company policy to ensure that any entry into enclosed space shall be made only if :
  - a. An enclosed space entry permit to work has been authorised and issued by the Master and that it is considered safe to do so.
  - b. Personnel entering the space will remain inside only as long as it is necessary to carry out the work. Under no circumstances shall personnel stay inside for a period exceeding 08 hours, as mandated by the permit to work.
- 5.6.2 The Master is fully responsible to ensure that the enclosed space is safe to enter,
- 5.6.3 Any personnel on board have the right to refuse entry into an unsafe enclosed space,
- 5.6.4 No personnel shall enter the enclosed space until all safety requirements have been met.

- 5.10.2 Atmospheric testing instruments must be visibly inspected for damage, batteries (where fitted) checked and the instrument "zeroed" (where possible) prior to use. If there is any doubt about the serviceability of the atmospheric testing instrument it should not be used, withdrawn from use and labelled "Defective - Not to be used".
- 5.10.3 Atmospheric testing instruments shall be provided with sufficient length of hose to reach the bottom of the space from the measuring point.
- 5.10.4 As a rule for measurement purposes the following shall be adhered to:
  - a. If the equipment is fitted with a manual hand rubber pump for drawing in atmospheric samples, then at least 4 squeezes of the hand pump are required for each metre length of the sampling hose.
  - b. If battery driven pumps are used for measurement, approximately 10 seconds for each metre of the sampling hose should be sufficient.

c. For toxic gas measurement, the sampling gas should have sufficient time to pass through the sampling hose.

# 5.11 ENGLOSED SPACE - VENTILATION PROCEDURE

- 5.11.1 Ventilation of the enclosed space must be continuous where possible because in many enclosed spaces the hazardous atmosphere will form again when the ventilation flow is stopped. All openings are to be opened up for ventilation including the emergency exits (if provided).
- 5.11.1 De-ballasting a tank does not guarantee a safe atmosphere and testing of the atmosphere is still required.
- 5.11.2 A common method of ventilation requires a large hose, one end attached to a fan (positioned in an area where the air is 100% fresh) and the other lowered into a manhole or opening. For example, a manhole would have ventilating hose run to the bottom of the enclosed space (see figure) to dilute or displace all harmful gases or vapours.

# Schematic Principles for Ventilation:

![](_page_109_Figure_7.jpeg)

# 5.12 ENCLOSED SPACE - ISOLATION PROCEDURE

- 5.12.1 The Master, Chief Officer and Chief Engineer shall evaluate the need for isolation of the enclosed space from service before any decision on personnel entry is made.
- 5.12.2 No personnel entry is to be made at all inside any cargo, ballast or fuel tank if ballast, cargo or fuel is to be transferred into or out of any tank on board, including the tank to be entered.
- 5.12.3 No cargo, ballasting or fuelling operations are to be carried out if personnel entry is to be made into any cargo, ballast or fuel tanks.
- 5.12.4 Isolation of a confined space is a process where the space is removed from service by one or more of the following methods:
  - Locking Out: Electrical sources preferably disconnected by using switches remote from a. the equipment.
  - b. Blanking, Securing Valves: Cargo, ballast, fuel and hydraulic lines passing through the enclosed space should be isolated by closing valves or blanked off. An alternative to pipe blanking would be to remove a section of the line.
  - Disconnecting: Mechanical linkages on shaft driven linkages (if any present in the C. enclosed space) must be disconnected and tagged.
  - ପ୍ରଦାସ ପର୍ Securing: Mechanical moving parts within the enclosed space must be secured with latches, chains, chocks, blocks or other suitable devices.
  - i. Notice boards: Appropriate notices, clearly specifying which enclosed spaces and requirements agreed upon must be clearly displayed on bridge and Engine room.

# 5.13 ENCLOSED SPACE - STANDBY / RESCUE

- 5.13.1 A standby person should be assigned to remain on the outside of the enclosed space at all times and be in constant contact (visual or two-way voice communication) with the personnel inside the enclosed space. The routine communication interval with the personnel inside the enclosed space shall not exceed 15 minutes.
- 5.13.2 The standby person shall abide by the following instructions:
  - a. Must not perform any other duties other than to serve as standby and should know who is to be notified in case of emergency.
  - b. permission of the Responsible or Competent person as per 5.5.3
  - c. should not leave the post even after help has arrived, as he/she is the key communication link on board
  - d.
- 5.13.3 In event of rescue, the standby person must be trained to follow established emergency procedures and use appropriate equipment and techniques.
- 5.13.4 Emergency and evacuation procedures should be agreed and understood by all the personnel involved, Rescue should be well planned and plans for drills and training for rescue from enclosed spaces must be carried out frequently as per the Company Drills and Training Matrices.

#### 6.0 HOT WORK

# Hot Work should only be considered if there is no other practical alternative means of carrying out repairs on board.

Hot Work carried out on board fleet vessels is controlled by the Permit to Work (PTW) system (as per Section 5 of this chapter) irrespective of location.

#### 6.1 PROHIBITION OF HOT WORK

Hot Work is strictly prohibited when vessel is performing any of the following operations:

- ത് Anchor handling, except if operational requirement or emergency repairs
- b. IMDG/NLX Cargo handling & operations
- C. Bunkering
- ರ Tank cleaning or Gas freeing
- e. Within 500 mtr zone of any installation
- f. Any other situation where hot work may possess danger to vessel and surrounding

#### 62 AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBLITY

The overall authority whether the use of Hot Work is justified rests with the Master in consultation with the shore management and he must delegate the responsible officer (Chief Engineer) to approve and complete the PTW before any hot work can commence.

- 6.2.1 Only one Hot Work operation should be performed at any given time on board the vessel.
- 6.2.2 A thorough risk assessment should be carried out to identify the hazards and assess the risks involved. This process of risk assessment should ensure that the protective and

{114}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_114_Picture_0.jpeg)

- 6.7.3 Hot work inside enclosed spaces must strictly follow the guidelines provided in section 5.5-5.13 and 5.14-5.17 of this chapter, the space has been made safe, proved to be safe and all permissions from shore authorities and management have been obtained.
- 6.7.4 Hot Work inside the enclosed space when associated with fuel tanks and fuel pipelines must take into account the possible presence of hydrocarbon vapours in the atmosphere and the existence of potential ignition sources.

# 6.8 PROVISION OF FLASHBACK ARRESTOR AND GAS REGULATOR.

- 6.8.1 Where any hot work involving oxygen and acetylene gas is carried out on board, the Chief Officer / Chief Engineer are to ensure that the equipment is provided with the following safety devices prior to commencement of hot work :
  - a. the manufacturer's instructions to prevent the back flow of gas.
  - b. A flashback arrestor to stop flashback shall be fitted in line with manufacturer's instructions between oxygen and acetylene outlet and the pressure regulator outlet of each gas cylinder on the supply line.
- 6.8.2 Should a back fire or back flow occur, the recommended first action will be to close the oxygen valve on the blow pipe followed by closing the acetylene gas at the blow pipe so as to prevent internal burning.

# 6.9 WELDING AND BURNING EQUIPMENT

- 6.9.1 Welding and other equipment used for Hot Work must be carefully inspected before each occasion of use to ensure that it is in good condition. Where required it must be correctly earthed, special attention must be paid to the following:
  - Electrical supply connections are made in gas free space. a.
  - Existing supply wiring is adequate to carry the electrical current demand without ﻓ overloading or excessive heating.
  - Insulation of flexible electrical cables is in good condition. c.
  - The cable route to the work site is the safest possible, only passing over gas free ರ or inerted spaces.
  - The earthing connection and the earth return cable leads directly back to the e. welding machine. The ship structure must not be used as an earth return.
- 6.9.2 If there is any doubt about the serviceability of the equipment, it should not be used, withdrawn from use and labelled "Defective - Not to be used".

# 6.10 Precautions to be Taken During Electric-Arc Welding

- a) The welding operator should wear the protective clothing specified earlier but should additionally wear non-conducting safety footwear. Clothing should be kept as dry as possible as some protection against electric shock. It is particularly important that gloves should be dry because wet leather is a good conductor.
- b) be alert to the risk of accidental shock to the welder, ready to cut off power instantly, raise the alarm and apply artificial respiration without delay. The desirability of a second assistant should be considered if the work is to be carried out in difficult conditions.
- c) Where persons other than the operator are likely to be exposed to harmful radiation or sparks from electric arc welding, they should be protected by screens or other effective means.

- d) or is likely to make contact in the course of ordinary movements, protection should be provided by dry insulating mats or boards.
- e) There are increased risks of electric shock to the operator if welding is done in hot or humid conditions; body sweat and damp clothing greatly reduce body resistance. Under such conditions, the operation should be deferred until such time as an adequate level of safety can be achieved.
- f) In no circumstances should a welder work while standing in water or with any part of his body immersed.
- g) The electrode holder should be isolated from the current supply before a used electrode is removed and before a new electrode is inserted. This precaution is necessary because some electrode coatings have extremely low resistance. Even a flux coating which is normally insulating can become damp from sweating hands and thus potentially dangerous. When the welding operation is completed or temporarily suspended, the electrode should be removed from the holder.
- h) Hot electrode ends should be ejected into a suitable container; they should not be handled with bare hands. Spare electrodes should be kept dry in their container until required for use.

#### 6.10.1 Protective Clothing

- a) Protective clothing and equipment complying with the relevant BS specifications should be worn by the operator and as appropriate by those working with him to protect them from particles of hot metal and slag and from accidental burns and their eyes and skin from ultra-violet and heat radiation.
- The operator should normally wear: b)
  - welding helmet with suitably coloured transparent eye piece. Eye goggles or a hand-held shield may be suitable alternatives in appropriate circumstances;
  - leather working gloves;
  - leather apron (in appropriate circumstances);
  - long-sleeved natural fibre boiler suit or other approved protective clothing.
- c) Clothing should be free of grease and oil and other flammable substances

# 6.10.2 Precautions Against Fire or Explosion

- a) Before welding, flame-cutting or other hot work is begun, a check should be made that there are no combustible solids, liquids or gases, at, below or adjacent to the area of the work, which might be ignited by heat or sparks from the work.
- b) Welding or other hot work should never be undertaken on surfaces covered with grease. oil or other flammable or combustible substances.
- c) When welding is to be done in the vicinity of open hatches, suitable screens should be erected to prevent sparks dropping down hatchways or ventilators. Where necessary, combustible materials should be moved to a safe distance before commencing operations.
- d) Openings through which sparks may fall should be closed where practicable.
- Welding or other hot work must be suitably screened from the production platform e) alongside to avoid the naked flame or arc triggering ultra-violet alarms on the platform.

- Where work is being done close to or at bulkheads, decks or deck-heads, the remote sides of the divisions should be checked for materials and substances which may ignite. and for cables, pipelines or other services which may be affected by the heat.
- Fuel tanks or other tanks or spaces that have contained flammable substances should be ଦି certified as being free of flammable gases before any repair work is commenced. The testing should include, as appropriate, the testing of adjacent spaces, void spaces, etc. Further tests should be carried out at regular intervals and before hot work is recommenced following any suspension of the work. Welding and flame-cutting operations should be properly supervised and kept under regular observation. Suitable fire extinquishers should be kept at hand ready for use during the operation. A person with a suitable extinguisher should also be stationed to keep watch on areas not visible to the welder which may be affected.
- h) appropriate frequent checks should be made for at least two hours after cessation of the work.

#### 6.10.3 Welding

Hazards from electric welding are greatly reduced from that of gas. Indeed these may be restricted to four categories:

- radiation
- electrocution
- fume
- housekeeping

#### 6.10.4 Radiation

- a) Radiation, as a result of ultra-violet rays in the welding arc (arc eye) can be extremely painful and may result even from short exposure to the arc. Generally it develops a few hours after exposure and manifests itself as sore gritty eyes, pain from bright lights and headache. Usually last in the region of 24 hours with no long term effects.
- b) Prevention may be directly to the welder by the use of suitable visor, but for others may take the form of a screen to prevent flash. Due consideration should also be given to the light that may be reflected from surrounding surfaces and walls.
- c) Also consider removal of slag when chipping welds to prevent penetration of the eye by chipped material, the slag will probably be extremely hot.

#### 6.10.5 Electrocution

- a) This is an ever present risk when using any form of electrically energised plant/equipment, and can be greatly reduced by the taking of some fundamental precautionary measures:
  - Correctly earth all plant/equipment and work and ensure all insulation is in good condition.
  - Ensure work area is dry, free from sharp objects and generally in a clean condition.
  - Switch off power when plant/equipment is not in use.
  - All plant/equipment must be regularly inspected and maintained.
  - Repairs, servicing, maintenance must only be carried out by qualified persons.
  - Avoid dragging cables across areas where damage may occur from exposed edges.
  - Ensure personnel are aware of procedure in cases of emergency (electric shock).
  - Ensure mains isolation switches are local to the plant operation.
  - Ensure electrodes are maintained in a good condition with sound insulating material.

#### 6.10.6 Fume

- a) Fume is generally caused as a result of the work piece being welded and the silicon based coatings in the welding electrodes. Symptoms will generally manifest themselves in the form of severe headache, shivering, aching in the joints and a high temperature with overall feeling similar to a bad bout of influenza.
- This is generally referred to as metal fume fever. It can be prevented by either local ﻣﻦ ﺍﻟﻤﺴﺎﻋﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺤﺪﺓ ventilation, either in the overall workplace or more specifically at the point of the weld.
- c) Some forms of exposure can be particularly serious, especially when welding such materials as lead, cadmium or similar and can even in some cases be fatal. These unsatisfactory work practices must be avoided at all costs, or be provided with suitable and/or improved local exhaust ventilation.

#### 6.10.7 Housekeeping

Housekeeping is important at all work site locations, but is of particular importance where electric arc welding plant is in use. Some points of consideration may be:

- Avoid excessive runs of trailing leads which as well as posing a tripping hazard may in addition be crushed by plant/equipment landing on it or similarly damaged by sharp objects being dropped on to the cables.
- Where work occurs over open mesh floors the positioning of a fire proof blanket or timber cover deck will prevent the fall of hot or other materials to a lower level. This is particularly important in the case of electrodes.
- Ensure the provision at the work-site of suitable fire fighting equipment.
- Ensure welding sets where sited are in such a position that they do not obstruct access ways or impede passage of persons along emergency escape routes.
- Ensure all plant is isolated when not in use.
- Where necessary place warning notices advising of the works that are in progress.

#### 7.0 Working at Heights

- 7.1 Whenever working at heights cannot be eliminated, a task risk assessment shall be completed;
  - · Before the commencement of work.
  - · At any time the scope of work changes.
  - · At any time the potential risk increases the likelihood for a fall,
- 7.2 When an employee works at elevations of 2 metres or more, he or she shall wear fall restraint/arrest equipment.

#### 9 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (MOC)

#### 9.1 Purpose

Change is an event or issue where there is a transition from one situation or state to a different one, it may be temporary or permanent substitution, alteration, replacement (not in kind), modification by addition or deletion or organisation, personnel, critical equipment, applicable codes, operating limits, procedures, emergency response equipment from the present configuration whether they are planned or in event of emergency. It can be any planned or enforced change, temporary or permanent, in people, plant and/or process for operational activities. All steps shall be taken to guard against unforeseen hazard and mitigate the risks that could result from poor management of change.

The principle of Management of Change is that approval for any change must be given by the right authority and only after a systematic process to examine the impact and management of any associated risks.

It is appreciated that the application of this Procedure will vary widely depending on the nature of the Change and associated risks. Office Management who review and approve Changes have a responsibility for deciding the depth to which this Procedure needs to be followed to manage the Change, based on the guidance provided in this Procedure, and ensuring that all elements are covered.

#### 92 Responsibility

- a. The overall responsibility for managing the changes affecting various activities in office and Vessels lie with the Director PFS.
- b. The DPA/MR is responsible for monitoring the changes affecting the office.
- c. The respective department Manager is responsible for carrying out the MOC process in the office and, where necessary, changes affecting vessel.
- d. The Master is responsible for monitoring the changes affecting the vessel.
- e. Each and every employee of the company has the responsibility to become aware of the Management of change and actively participate in the process.

#### 9.3 Terminology

Change: Changes are modifications, additions, or substitutions for any aspect within the organization that are outside the company's present specifications and procedures.

Initiator: Person proposing change, it can be anybody within the company or vessel. The initiator works with the change owner to prepare the supporting documentation required by the MOC.

Change Owner: Office Manager/Superintendent/Master and or CE with responsibility in the area where the change is proposed and who works with the initiator in preparing the change form request. If the initiator is a shipboard officer or above, then the initiator and change owner are one and the same.

Approver: A member of office management who reviews the initial change to confirm the need for change and validate the preliminary impact assessment and the implementation plan. If the change has major impacts and it is particularly complex, the approver is strongly advised to request further detailed risk assessment.

MOC: Acronym for "Management of Change". It is also used to refer to a proposed change that is going through the management of change process.

MOC Form: The MOC form is essentially the record for each change. The form is essential to allow the necessary information to be gathered and recorded efficiently and effectively.

MOC Log: The MOC log functions like a summary register of all changes onboard and in the office. The information contained in the log can show at a glance which changes are open, which are about to expire, and which are late and where actions need to be taken. The MOC log can be paper-based or electronic (Refer to appendix J3).

Onboard MOC Record: Master shall maintain a record of all the MOC forms and current status of each change. His/her job is to verify that changes are completed in a timely manner and updated and closed out as required.

Shore-side MOC Record: The HSE Manager shall be the shore-side MOC coordinator and will track MOC program performance, including the status of MOCs and MOC actions, and undertakes audits of MOC programs fleet wide and in office.

Replacement-in-kind: When an item, process, or person meets the existing specified criteria for the item it is replacing, it is typically not considered a change, but a replacement-in-kind.

# 9.5 Changes where an MOC process is not required

Addressing all possible types of changes with the MOC program will undeniably reduce the overall effectiveness of the system without adding significant benefit. Therefore, types of changes typically not governed by the MOC program include the following:

- a. Replacement in kind; a replacement-in-kind is a change wherein an item, process, or person meets the specified criteria for the item it is replacing, if such criteria exist. This may take the form of an identical replacement, or an alternative that is specifically designed within specifications criteria and therefore will not adversely affect the function of the system. An MOC programme should disregard changes that constitute a replacement-in-kind and focus on evaluating proposed temporary or permanent changes that are outside of the existing specified criteria. It is true that even a replacement obtained from the same manufacturer may have small differences from the original item it is replacing. The manufacturer may have utilized upgraded machinery, employed slightly different materials of construction, or may have stored the equipment at different environmental conditions. However, these physical changes may be considered minor component modifications that fall within the tolerable range of existing documented specifications. The limited risk of replacement-in-kind can be controlled outside the MOC program using other tools such as purchase requisition processes, checklists, safe work practices, etc.
- Changes that the company chooses to control via other management process; b. such as ·
  - Routine personnel changes (crew rotation) controlled by operating procedures, safe work practices, training, etc. If the Master or Chief Engineer is re-joining the same vessel or sister vessel and or if they are on back to back rotation, MOC will not be required.
  - Routine in-service changes where the operating procedures provide appropriate guidelines for the change, and the operating procedures have been adequately reviewed prior to becoming effective.
- Domestic activities (janitorial, food, beverage, laundry, housekeeping, etc.) C.
- d. Document changes as governed by IMS Manual, Chapter 10

#### MOC Process 9.6

The MOC process establishes control measures to achieve a systematic approach and is in stages covering the following key elements:

# Step 1: Identify: (Appraise and Select)

{123}------------------------------------------------

| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
|                                                          |                       | Issue Date    | 1st July 2014      |
|                                                          |                       | Issued by     | DPA                |
|                                                          |                       | Authorised By | Director PFS       |

The proposed change is identified by the person initiating the change, is the change a replacement in kind. i.e. a like-for-like replacement / repair, or where the activity is routine and already covered maintenance or operating procedures? If YES, the MOC process is not necessary, if NO, continue to follow this Procedure. The scope and requirements of the change are identified, including identifying the approval Authority. Requirements must be established and everyone who will need to be consulted about the change identified.

Once it is decided that the change is a type that needs to be managed within the MOC program, the next task is to brainstorm the potential impacts associated with the change is normally proposed because it is advantageous. However, a change that is not properly evaluated can also bring negative impacts that outweigh its benefits. The ultimate goal of an MOC program is to control the change process to minimize or eliminate any detrimental impact on safety, property, heath and the environment, as well as quality, security, or any other aspect of interest to the company.

The preliminary impact assessment is very important in an MOC program, and it should appropriately identify all potential impacts associated with the change. Hazard identification and Risk management is essential to secure completeness in the preliminary impact assessment. A useful tool to help the Initial Reviewers complete the preliminary impact assessment is a checklist, as well as prompts and guidance built into the MOC Form. A MOC form and preliminary impacts checklist can be found in Appendix J and Appendix J1, respectively,

# Step 2: Review: (Consultation with Management, Stakeholders and Subject Matter Experts)

Once the impacts are assessed during appraisal, the review step involves presentation of the initial analysis to the designated approval authority. Before a change can be implemented, the approver should review and concur with the basis for the change, confirm that the preliminary impact assessment did not identify significant concerns warranting cancellation of the proposed change, and provide agreement with the implementation plan. If the approver has a concern regarding the outcome of the Initial Review, one of several alternatives can be chosen:

- · The Initial Review is repeated but with a focused objective to provide substantial input in addressing the concerns raised by the approver, or
- · The change is rejected, and the MOC form is considered 'closed' and retained for future reference.
- · A more detailed form of risk assessment is requested to be developed and the resulting implementation plan approved before the change may be executed, as described in Step 3.

The implementation plan describes how the change will be executed and identifies specific actions, time limits, and responsibilities for addressing any HSEQ issue or any negative impact prior to the change being implemented. Typical action items in an implementation plan would be to determine the specific controls to mitigate risks associated with the change, the types of notification needed, training, documentation, etc.

An implementation plan shall not only indicate the actions needed for the execution of the change, but also assign responsibility for each action and identify a timeline for the actions to be completed.

# Step 3: Detailed Risk Assessment of Risks and Identification of Mitigating Actions)

In order to ensure the identification and implementation of suitable controls for the hazards associated with proposed changes, a Risk Assessment (see Section 4 and Appendices A and A1 of this procedure, IMS 03) must be carried out (where appropriate), mitigating steps identified and action items assigned. This Risk Assessment must also address the potential or actual impact on other persons, areas or activities that may be affected by the change.

When the preliminary impact assessment identifies that the change has potential for major consequences, or the complexity of the change warrants it, then a greater degree of scrutiny is required to assess the potential risks. In these cases, the approver must require a thorough and comprehensive risk assessment/mitigation.

{124}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_124_Picture_0.jpeg)

One of the main differences between the preliminary impact assessment and the detailed risk assessment is the number of people involved. The detailed risk assessment should be carried out by a team including subject matter experts from various disciplines as necessary.

# Step 4: Approval: (Authority for Approving Change)

The results of the initial impact analysis must be confirmed and validated by the approver. In order to adequately perform the technical review, it is critical that the approver be competent in the field or domain where the change is occurring. For instance, a non-engineering shore-based manager typically has not acquired the necessary competencies to solely provide acceptance for a structural change. Such a change is typically reviewed for approval by an appropriately qualified engineer or naval architect.

If the approver does not concur with the outcome of the assessments and the proposed implementation plan, he or she can reject the change and close out the MOC or ask for the detailed Risk Assessment to be revisited.

| Impact                                                             | Organisational        | Human                     | Engineering        | Operation             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Low Risk (as per RA evaluation)<br>Low cost impact <5000 USD       | Head of<br>Department | HR/Crewing<br>Manager     | Tech Super         | Ops Super<br>/Manager |
| Medium Risk(as per RA evaluation)<br>Medium Cost Impact <10000 USD | Head of<br>Department | HR Manager<br>/Crewing GM | Tech<br>Manager/GM | Ops HOD               |
| High Risk (as per RA evaluation)<br>High Cost Impact >10000 USD    | Director              | Director                  | Director           | Director              |

# Note: All ship initiated MOC proposals shall be approved by shore based management.

# Step 5: Implementation: (Developing the MOC Plan with actions and implementing the Change)

The MOC Plan is developed, which includes mitigating actions identified from the hazard identification, risk assessment and technical review. The implementation step is about executing the change and implementation plan. It also includes updating the documentation to reflect the change, communicating the change, and training personnel on the change.

# Step 6: Verification and Closeout: (Documenting the Change process, reviewing the Change and sharing lessons learned, closing out the Change)

Ensure that the change and all actions in the MOC Plan have been completed, i.e. the MOC has been performed as intended with any actions identified during the process being addressed and closed.

Once any change is implemented, it is good practice to revisit it in the short-term to assess effectiveness. It may be difficult to finish the update to documentation before the needed change is executed. This verification step will check that the follow-on work was performed prior to closing out the MOC.

Therefore, some of the questions to be answered during this verification step are as follows:

- · Are the changes meeting their intended functions?
- · Are the actions from the implementation plan being complied with and meeting the intended function?
- · Have the temporary changes expired? If so, can the system revert to its original state? If the answer is "no", proceed to convert to a permanent change, restarting the MOC review process.

{125}------------------------------------------------

#### 9.7 Temporary Changes

A temporary change is one that is intended to exist for a short and predetermined period of time. It is recognised that temporary changes, the duration of which could span several days or weeks, may be required. Where these are necessary, the time-frame for which a temporary change remains valid shall be specified as part of the risk assessment and must be documented on the MOC Plan and be communicated to everyone involved. The maximum length of time permitted for a temporary change shall not exceed six months, or until the next dry dock period.

The time-frame definition on the MOC Plan shall also specify when the risk assessment must be re-validated to ensure it remains fit for purpose for the temporary change. This control over time-frame and risk review is important to avoid the temporary change inadvertently becoming a permanent one.

If a decision is reached that a temporary change should become permanent then the change must be re-evaluated and documented in accordance with this Procedure. Temporary changes must have a specified time limit to ensure they are returned to the original system condition or that further steps in managing the change are addressed (i.e., converting the temporary change into a permanent change).

All temporary changes must be reviewed before the expiry date to verify that:

- · The system was returned to its original condition, or ...
- · Conversion was initiated to make the temporary change a permanent part of the system (new MOC required), or ...
- · The period for validity of the temporary change was extended. Note : Extending the validity of temporary change should not routinely be allowed; only in exceptional circumstances. Such an extension requires careful consideration and documentation in the MOC form, which includes as a minimum, re-validating the impact or risk assessment, and proper approvals.

9.8 Emergency Changes: Where change is required in emergency situations, the person-in-charge for the area concerned must ensure that risks associated with the emergency change are assessed and that authorisation to make the emergency change is obtained. Change requests which need to be implemented within 24 hrs shall be categorised as emergency change. During emergency change request, the review should include as much of the normal process as possible. Later on, the complete change process shall be completed as soon as possible.

An emergency change is a change that must be performed in a true emergency. Generally, the situation is such that action is required quickly, and the persons required to provide approvals may not be available to meet the requirements of the written MOC process. In these "emergency" situations, safety could be jeopardized by waiting for completion of the formal MOC process. In an emergency situation, the change should be reviewed to the best of the staff's abilities. This emergency MOC process should involve a risk assessment using any and all available resources and time to evaluate the risks involved with the change and it may be verbal, rather than written (however where possible a record should be maintained- log or email). The focus should be on the immediate risks only. The verbal implementation plan should also be developed and carried out by relevant personnel, with approval from the highest ranking personnel available with domain expertise.

At first opportunity after the emergency has been controlled, the change must be fully evaluated and documented using the MOC procedure. The reviews will dictate if the change should be:

- · Reversed to continue operations as in the pre-emergency status or
- · Converted to a temporary or permanent change.

Bearing in mind the limited time and resources in the midst of an emergency, the output from the retrospective MOC process review can also propose a different change to address the problems that caused or resulted from the emergency.

#### 10 BEHAVIOUR BASED SAFETY (BBS)

- 10.1 BBS (sometimes referred to in the Offshore Industry as Unsafe Acts) relates to the behaviour of people and is an observation and intervention process intended for all individuals to visibly and personally demonstrate care and concern for the safety of others. All observed unsafe acts (at , risk behaviours) and unsafe conditions are addressed and corrected immediately.
- 10.2 If a person (observer) notices somebody (observed person or "OP") doing something unsafe or working in an unsafe way, then the observer should immediately advise the OP to stop what they are doing, in order to prevent an accident or incident. The observer should then explain to the OP why it was an unsafe practice and suggest a better and/or safer way of working or carrying out the task. The OP should then record the intervention on a BBS Observation Card.
- 10.3 BBS is not intended to blame or victimise personnel for unsafe acts, hence there is no requirement to name names (NO NAME, NO BLAME). On the contrary, it is intended encourage all to look out for one another's safety and promote open reporting of unsafe acts so that everyone will benefit from the lessons learned.
- 10.4 Personnel are encouraged to submit at least one BBS observation per month using the form provided in Appendix K. The BBS observation must be genuine and reflect real occurrences onboard. A seemingly large number of BBS observations should not be thought of as a bad reflection upon the safety culture onboard the vessel. On the contrary, it reflects the safety consciousness onboard and shows that safety matters are being effectively addressed.
- 10.5 During the monthly shipboard HSE meeting, the HSE Chairman will discuss all the BBS observations and review the content. He will also use this opportunity to encourage a positive safety culture onboard. The summary of BBS observations is to be submitted to the HSEQA Dept along with the Minutes of the Shipboard HSE Meeting.

# 11 HAZARDOUS OBSERVATIONS (HAZOBS)

- 11.1 Hazardous Observations (HAZOBS sometimes referred to in the Offshore Industry as "Unsafe Conditions") relates to the condition of the ship itself and/or its equipment and is a system for the reporting of unsafe conditions related directly to safety.
- 11.2 As with BBS, personnel are encouraged to immediately report any HAZOB to the Master or Chief Engineer who will, at the end of the month, summarise and report them to the HSEQA Dept., as well as raise a defect to the appropriate Technical Superintendent.
- 11.3 I It should be borne in mind that the HAZOBS system is not intended for reporting technical defects onboard the vessel, unless the defect directly affects the safety of personnel onboard. Non safety related defects are to be reported using a Defect Form (refer to Company PMS) to the vessel's Technical Superintendent for rectification, and summarised in the ship's monthly HSE Report.

#### SAFETY STATISTICS & TRENDING 12

- 12.1 The HSEQA Dept records, analyses, and tracks all reported NCR's, accidentlincident & near misses, BBS Observations and HAZOBS in order to ensure continuous tracking and timely feedback between the Company and the vessels. Appropriate recommendations and follow up actions can be effectively implemented in an effort to continuously improve upon the Safe Operating of the Company Fleet.
- 12.2 Vessel Masters are also required to monitor NCR's, accidentlincident & near misses, BBS Observations and HAZOBS to ensure corrective action taken is effective and measures are implemented to prevent recurrence.
- 12.3 The records are consolidated on a monthly basis by the HSEQA Department and are discussed during the monthly Fleet HSE meeting. Important or significant findings are addressed with

conclusions and recommendations/requirements disseminated to the Fleet via the minutes of the meeting.

12.4 Using the records, comparisons may be made on a month-by-month, bi-annual and year-to-date basis in order to analyse trends and highlight improvements or deficiencies.

#### 13 HSE PLAN AND BRIDGING DOCUMENT

- 13.1 This HSE Bridging Document is an interface document specifically developed to define the processes to be adopted and implemented by SR MARINE in controlling and safely managing an operation in line with charterer's objectives and expectations. The document defines the relationship between SR MARINE and Charterer in executing the scope of work in the operational area as defined in the scope of work.
- 13.2 Additionally, the HSE Bridging Document is developed to assist in identifying and managing the operational hazards/risks and put in place the necessary controls and/or safeguards for the parties / work group interfaces, thereby ensuring that the operational aspects of the work are not HSE compromised through minimising the impact of an incident.
- 13.3 The aim of this HSE Bridging Document is to convey emergency incident communication and response guidelines, in order to ensure that safe and reliable performance requirements are met. The HSE Bridging Document bridges the Charter's documents covering the handling of incidents and the SR MARINE HSEQ Integrated Management System (IMS) and other documents as developed and implemented by SR MARINE

The purposes prescribed herein are as follows:

- · To enable achievement of the highest possible standards in the areas of health, safety and environment management and compliance;
- To ensure that key responsibilities are clearly defined and understood;
- To ensure that all communication links are clearly defined and understood;
- To ensure that emergency response plans have been established and are understood by all parties;
- To ensure that all personnel are fully aware of the HSE requirements for any given situation and that they are clearly defined, understood, implemented and followed.
- 13.4 The HSE plan identifies the existing policies, plans and procedures already in place to cover HSE objectives by SR MARINE. It also identifies HSE issues that have been addressed previously as well as the HSE issues addressed in the current charterer and during the actual execution of the project. This plan should be used in conjunction with the SR MARINE HSEQ Integrated Management System (IMS) Manual.

#### 14 HSE MONITORING PLAN

The company has developed a HSE monitoring plan, which indentifies various aspects of company HSE management. The HSE monitoring plan, is maintained, monitored and tracked by HSE Department for its effective implementation.

#### 1. PERSONNEL SAFETY AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH

#### 1.1 Purpose

· The purpose of this procedure is to address the safety and occupational health issues faced by all seagoing staff in the operation of the Company vessels.

#### 1.2 Scope

It is the Company's philosophy that the safety and health of its seagoing staff is paramount. This procedure and others within the IMS address that philosophy and, in doing so, meet the requirements of the ISM Code and the OHSAS 18001 standard.

The Company ensures that their entire seagoing staff is holding appropriate and verified Certificates of Competency as per statutory requirements, thereby ensuring they have undergone the appropriate training, including safety training.

Nevertheless, such safety training should be regarded as providing only a basic knowledge of personal safety, hence the need for this procedure to provide guidance in this respect.

#### 2. Procedure

# PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)

Regardless of practicalities of work or economics, safety will not be compromised. All personnel onboard SR MARINE vessels will abide by SR MARINE safety standards including the wearing of appropriate PPE.

#### 2.1. PPE Requirements

- a. All personnel must wear the appropriate PPE as provided by the Company when working. Even if a crew member is just 'lending a hand" to a work activity during an off duty period, appropriate PPE must still be worn.
- b. In effect, any work activity (particularly work outside the accommodation) requires the use of appropriate PPE.
  - R Safety shoes or boots must be worn in working areas where danger exists. This will be in all areas outside of the accommodation and in the galley work areas and in designated areas ashore. Safety shoes with worn or broken soles, damaged uppers or toecap protruding should be replaced. Lace-up type boots should always be worn properly tied up.
  - The Chief Officer is responsible to ensure that all PPE is in good condition and 11. properly maintained. He must ensure that is sufficient PPE onboard and requisition as required. In the event that adequate PPE has not been supplied to the vessel, the DPA/HSEQA Department must be informed accordingly.
  - iii. At the individual level, crew are responsible for checking their own PPE and highlighting any deficiencies.
  - iv. Long sleeve overalls, as provided by the Company should be worn when working onboard. As far as reasonable practicable, overalls should be clean with the Company Logos intact. Very dirty, torn or oily overalls should be disposed of and replaced.

#### 3. RISK ASSESSMENT AND TOOLBOX TALKS

#### 3.1. Health Risk Assessment

The Risk Assessment process and matrix as described in IMS 03 has been designed and developed in such a way that it can be used for assessing the health risks associated with any work to be carried out on board Company vessels, as well as for assessing safety and environmental risks

The purpose of the Risk Assessment is to highlight the risks involved in the task to be carried out and identify the mitigating steps necessary to reduce the risk to as low as reasonably practical (ALARP).

It is mandatory to carry out a Risk Assessment for all on board tasks and all personnel that will be involved must also be involved in the risk assessment process.

#### Toolbox Talks 3.2.

Toolbox Talks should be considered as a job briefing and a follow on to the Risk Assessment. They are a forum for the supervisor and/or person in charge of a job to ensure that the personnel carrying out the work fully understand the job requirements and they are reminded of the hazards involved, the procedures to be followed and the precautions to be taken, as identified in the Risk Assessment.

# 4. CONTROL AND HANDLING OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES/MATERIAL

#### 4.1. General

There are a number of Hazardous Substances that may be encountered on board, either materials being transported on behalf of a customer or for use on board the vessel itself,

The Hazardous Substances may include, but not be limited to the following:

- Paint 0
- Solvents 0
- Fuel Oil
- . Lubricating Oils and Hydraulic Oils
- De-rusting Fluids .
- Cleaning Agents
- Substances being carried that are identified as dangerous under the International . Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code

#### 4.2. Precautions

- a) Prior to handling potentially hazardous substances, read the manufacturer's safety instructions and the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and comply fully with all recommended precautions and PPE requirements. If the MSDS is not provided when the substance is delivered to the vessel, do not accept it onboard. The MSDS should, where practicable, be kept with the substance as it provides information on the material itself and what to do in the event of various types of emergencies. The manufacturer's instructions should also be read and observed.
- Protective clothing must always be worn to safeguard the person against accidental ﮯ spillage and eye and respiratory protection will be necessary in most cases of handling.
- c) completed and sent as soon as possible to Head Office and recorded onboard. A summary of the illness should be recorded in the vessel's Monthly HSE minutes.

{155}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_155_Picture_0.jpeg)

- d) For IMDG Cargoes, the IMDG Code provides details of storage, transportation and incompatibilities as well as information on the material itself and what to do in the event of various types of emergencies.
- Paints and/or Chemicals may contain toxic or irritant substances, and with solvents may e) give rise to toxic, flammable and potentially explosive vapours.
- Associated materials such as rust removers and acids are also hazardous and skin f) contact should be avoided.
- g) All such materials, whether for use on board or being transported must be properly stored at all times.
- h) Internal / enclosed spaces should be atmosphere monitored and well ventilated at all times.
- i) Correct protective clothing should always be worn.
- i) No smoking in areas of painting or using chemicals.
- No naked lights in areas of painting or using chemicals. k)
- If paint is to be sprayed, the manufacturer's instructions for the equipment should be ﮯ read and adhered to.
- m) Paint may be sprayed at high velocity and can cause damage to the skin and eyes. Great care and supervision is required.
- n) Proper protective clothing is required such as combination suits, gloves and goggles.
- o)

#### 4.3 Handling Liquefied Gas

The following safeguards should be observed when handling packaged liquefied gas cargoes:

- a) Pressurised receptacles should be suitably protected against physical damage from other cargo, stores or equipment.
- b) Pressurised receptacles should not be over-stowed with other heavy goods or other items.
- c) Pressurised receptacles should be stowed in such a position that the safety relief device is in contact with the vapour space within the receptacle.
- d) Valves should be protected against any form of physical damage with a suitable protection cap in place at all times when the cylinder is not in use.
- e) Cylinders stowed below deck should be in compartments or holds capable of being ventilated and away from accommodation and working areas and all sources of heat
- f) Oxygen cylinders should be stowed separately from flammable gas cylinders.

{156}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_156_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### 4.4 Ship's Stores

#### General a)

Any chemical or hazardous material placed on board a ship as stores should be accompanied by a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). Where MSDS is not found or provided and the item is already taken onboard, the item should be isolated and stored in accordance with guidance provided on its container or packaging. It should not be put into use until satisfactory user information is provided.

Containers and packages should be stowed closed and the storage location kept clean and tidy.

#### b) Paint

Paint, paint thinners and associated cleaners and hardeners should be stowed in storage location protected by fixed fire extinguishing arrangements approved by the administration. (SOLAS II-2 Regulation 10 Section 6.3 as amended covers Spaces Containing Flammable Liquid.)

#### Chemicals C)

All chemicals should be stowed in designated and dedicated storage locations. Care should be taken to ensure that incompatible chemicals are stowed separately, Information on the fire-fighting medium for each chemical should be really available from the product's MSDS.

#### d) Cleaning Liquids

It is preferable to use cleaning liquids that are non-toxic and non-flammable. If flammable liquids are used, they should have a high flashpoint. High volatile liquids, such as gasoline or naphtha, should never be used in engine or boiler rooms.

Flammable cleaning liquids should be kept in closed, unbreakable, correctly labelled containers and should be stored in a suitable compartment when not in use.

Cleaning liquids should only be used in places where ventilation is adequate, taking into consideration the volatility of the liquids being used. All such liquids should be stowed and used in compliance with the manufacturer's instructions.

Direct skin contact with, or the contamination of clothing by, cleaning liquids should be avoided.

#### Spare gear Storage e)

Spare gear is not inherently hazardous. There have, however, been cases where large items of spare gear stowed on deck have broken free of their lashings with consequent damage to the vessel and risk of injury to personnel. When stowing spare gear, the following should be borne in mind:

- · It should allow safe access to, and operation of, any safety equipment.
- · It should not interfere with mooring or other operations.
- · It should be properly lashed, taking into account expected weather on the voyage.

#### 4.5 Cargo and Bunker Samples

All cargo samples should be stowed securely in lockers that have access external to accommodation. Consideration should be given to storing samples in a location protected by a fixed fire-fighting system, such as paint locker. The number of samples retained on board should be carefully managed and, when no longer required, they should be disposed in accordance with Marpol regulation.

The Company should have a policy that addresses the disposal of samples; the aim should be to minimize the period of retention after the relevant cargo has been discharged. Unless the

{157}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_157_Picture_0.jpeg)

company advises to the contrary, it is suggested that samples are retained for a period of three months after the cargo has been discharged.

#### 4.6 Other Materials

#### Sawdust, Oil Absorbent Granules and Pads a.

The use of saw dust for cleaning up small oil spills on board ship is discouraged. If sawdust is carried on board, care should be taken to ensure that, while unused, it is stowed in a dry condition and, if possible, in a cool location. Moist sawdust is susceptible to spontaneous combustion.

When sawdust has been used to clean up a minor oil spill, the contaminated sawdust should be stowed separately, in a sealed container and in safe location, clear of the accommodation and hazardous areas.

Any oil-impregnated absorbent granules or pads should be stowed in dedicated containers on board, clear of the accommodation and hazardous areas.

Oil-impregnated sawdust and absorbent granules should be disposed of early as possible, either ashore or via the ship's waste incinerator.

#### b. Garbage

The storage locations for garbage should be carefully selected to ensure that the garbage presents no potential hazard to adjacent spaces.

Particular consideration should be given to the storage of garbage that is designated as 'special waste', such as batteries, sensors and fluorescent tubes, to ensure that only compatible materials are stowed together .

The ICS publication 'Guideline for the Preparation of Garbage Management Plans' provides information on how to comply with Annex V of MARPOL.

#### 4.7 Packaged Cargoes

# a.

Packed petroleum cargoes are usually shipped in steel drums of approximately 200 litres capacity. Product transported in this manner include gasoline, kerosene, gas oils and lubricating oil

In addition to the general safety precautions for handling bulk petroleum, the following procedures should be observed when handling packaged petroleum products.

#### b. Loading and Discharging

Packages petroleum and other flammable liquids should not be handled during the loading of volatile petroleum in bulk, except with the express permission of both the Responsible Officer and loading of bulk cargo should be suspended owing to the increased risk of spark generation.

#### C. Precautions During Handling

A responsible Officer should supervise the handling of packaged petroleum and other flammable liquids. The following precautions should be taken :

- Stevedores must comply with smoking restrictions and other safety regulations. i.
- When permanent hatch protection is not fitted, temporarily protection should be ﻨﺘ provided to avoid the risk of spark being caused by hoist striking the hatch coamings, hatch sides or hold ladders.

- All hoists should be of a size suitable for passing through hatches with ample iii. clearance
- iv. Fibre rope slings, cargo nets, or drum hooks on wire rope or chain slings, should be used for handling loose drums.
- Goods should preferably be palleted and secured. Pallets should be lifted with pallet lifting gear with safety nets. If goods are not presented on pallets, cargo trays or fibre rope slings may be used. The use of cargo nets for packaged goods is generally to be discouraged as they are liable to cause damaged to the packaging.
- vi. Loose gas cylinders should be handled with cargo nets of a sufficiently small mesh to prevent them falling through the net. Cylinders should never be handled by the valve or protection cap. Cylinders should never be lifted on board using lifting magnets, chains, clings or strops. A cylinder trolley or other appropriate device should be used when moving cylinders, even for short distances.
- vii. Each package should be inspected for leakage or damage before being stowed, and any found defective to an extent likely to impair safety should be rejected.
- viii. Packages should be placed on dunnage on the deck.
- ix. Packages should not be dragged across the deck or hold and should not be allowed to slide or roll free.
- Cans and drums should be stowed with caps and end plugs uppermost. X. x
- When securing the cargo, each tier should be separated by dunnage. The xi. height to which cargo can be safely stowed should be related to the nature, size and strength of the packages. Advice should be obtained from the terminal or shipper, as appropriate.
- Sufficient suitable dunnage should be used to prevent possible damage during xii. the voyage.
- The cargo should be properly secured to prevent any movement during the xiii. voyage.
- xiv . During darkness, adequate approved lighting should be provided.
- xv. Empty receptacles, unless gas free, should be treated as filled receptacles.

#### 4.8 Dangerous Goods

Dangerous goods are classified in Chapter VII of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974.

The Master should only permit aboard the ship packaged dangerous goods, which have been properly identified by the shipper of the goods and declared as being properly packaged, marked and labelled in compliance with the appropriate provisions of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, taking into consideration, as appropriate, the IMO 'Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Cargoes and related Activities in Port Areas'

Before accepting the cargo, the Master should check that he has received adequate advice on any special properties of the cargo, on procedures for entering an enclosed compartment containing the cargo, and for dealing with any leak, spill, inhalation, skin contact or fire.

Attention is drawn to the advice for dealing with spillage or fire contained in the IMO guide 'Emergency Procedures for Ships Carrying Dangerous Goods - Group Emergency Schedules',

The Master should ensure that the dangerous good loaded in the ship are properly stowed and segregated as recommend in the IMDG Code, taking into consideration, as appropriate, the IMO 'Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Cargoes and Related Activity in Port Areas'.

#### 5 MANUAL HANDLING TECHNIQUES

#### 5.1 Introduction

- i. Manual handling injuries can occur wherever people are at work. Heavy manual labour, awkward postures, manual materials handling and previous or existing injury are all risk factors implicated in the development of Musculoskeletal Disorders.
- This section will help prevent these injuries and is likely to be cost effective. However, 11. not all injuries can be prevented, so it is still essential to encourage early reporting of symptoms and make arrangements for the proper treatment and rehabilitation of anybody who is injured.

#### 5.2 Good Handling Technique for Lifting

- i. Think before lifting/handling. Plan the lift. Can handling aids be used? Where is the load going to be placed? Will help be needed with the load? Remove obstructions such as discarded wrapping materials. For a long lift, consider resting the load midway on a table or bench to change grip.
- ii. Keep the load close to the waist. Keep the load close to the body for as long as possible while lifting. Keep the heaviest side of the load next to the body. If a close approach to the load is not possible, try to slide it towards the body before attempting to lift it.
- = Adopt a stable position. The feet should be apart with one leg slightly forward to maintain balance (alongside the load, if it is on the ground). The worker should be prepared to move their feet during the lift to maintain their stability.
- iv. Get a good hold. Where possible the load should be hugged as close as possible to the body. This may be better than gripping it tightly with hands only.
- Start in a good posture. At the start of the lift, slight bending of the back, hips and knees ﺧ is preferable to fully flexing the back (stooping) or fully flexing the hips and knees (squatting).
- vi. -Don't flex the back any further while lifting. This can happen if the legs begin to straighten before starting to raise the load.
- vii. Avoid twisting the back or leaning sideways, especially while the back is bent. Shoulders should be kept level and facing in the same direction as the hips. Turning by moving the feet is better than twisting and lifting at the same time.
- viii. Keep the head up when handling. Look ahead, not down at the load, once it has been held securely.
- İX. Move smoothly. The load should not be jerked or snatched as this can make it harder to keep control and can increase the risk of injury.

Don't lift or handle more than can be easily managed. There is a difference between X. what people can lift and what they can safely lift. If in doubt, seek advice or get help.

xi.

Put down, and then adjust. If precise positioning of the load is necessary, put it down first, and then slide it into the desired position.

# 5.3 Good Handling Technique for Pushing & Pulling

- រៈ Handling Device. Aids such as barrows and trolleys should have handle heights that are between the shoulder and waist. Devices should be well maintained with wheels that run smoothly (ensure equipment is maintained). When purchasing new trolleys etc. ensure they are of good quality with large diameter wheels made of suitable material and with castors, bearings etc which will last with minimum maintenance.
- ii. Force. As a rough guide the amount of force that needs to be applied to move a load over a flat, level using a well-maintained handling aid is at least 2% of the load weight. For example, if the load weight is 400 kg, then the force needed to move the load is 8 kg. The force needed will be larger, perhaps a lot larger, if conditions are not perfect (e.g. wheels not in the right position or a device that is poorly maintained). Try to push rather than pull when moving a load, provided you can see over it and control steering and stopping.
- iii. Slopes. Enlist help from others whenever necessary if you have to negotiate a slope on ramp, as pushing and pulling forces can be very high. For example, if a load is moved up a slope of 1 in 12 (about 5°), the required force is over 30 kg even in ideal conditions - good wheels and a smooth slope. This is above the guideline weight for men.
- Uneven Surfaces. Moving an object over soft or uneven surfaces requires higher forces. iv. On an uneven surface, the force needed to start the load moving could increase to 10% of the load weight, although this might be offset to some extent by using larger wheels. Soft ground may be even worse.
- Stance and Pace. To make it easier to push or pull, keep your feet well away from the load and go on faster than walking speed. This will stop you becoming too tired too quickly.

{161}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_161_Picture_0.jpeg)

# 5.4 Good Handling Techniques for Twisting

Reduce the guidelines weights if the handler twists to the side during the operation. As a rough guide, reduce them by 10% if the handler twists beyond 45° and by 20% if the handler twists beyond 90°.

#### 5.5 Slips, Trips and Falls

- Safety shoes should be worn by all personnel (including the catering staff) at all times 1. within the designated working areas. A large numbers of injuries occur because of using unsuitable footwear which does not grip the decks properly and/or protect the feet from falling objects, burns or scalds if liquids are split.
- 11.1 Working areas should be kept clear of grease, oil, rubbish and ice, etc to avoid slipping, Any spillage should be cleaned up immediately.
- iii. Working areas should be cleared from obstructions.
- iv. In galleys and messrooms, broken glass or crockery to be cleared away immediately.

#### 6 FIRE PRECAUTIONS

#### 6.1 Smoking

Fires are often caused by burning cigarette butts. Smoking is only permitted in certain locations on-board as designated by the Master and the Company "Smoking Policy". Smoking material should be extinguished properly. Smoking in bed is strictly prohibited and is a disciplinary offence.

#### 6.1 Electrical fittings

All electrical fittings should be of an approved type. Only qualified personnel are allowed to work on electrical equipment. Electrical fittings should be correctly installed. Loose wires, makeshift plugs and sockets are not acceptable and must be rectified.

#### 6.2 Oily rags

Heat can be generated from oily rags, cloths and sawdust etc. This can lead to spontaneous combustion and fire. Such rubbish should be properly stored until it can be disposed of. In all work spaces, e.g. engine room/pump room, great care should be taken with oily rags. Proper disposal containers should be provided.

#### 6.3 Cleanliness

The general upkeep of the vessel is essential for ensuring a working and living environment that is a minimum risk from fire. All machinery spaces should be kept clean and oil free at all times. Paint and other flammable liquids should only be stored in designated 'paint lockers' provided with sprinkler systems. All paint used on a daily basis should be returned to the 'paint locker' after use. Metal swarf must not be allowed to accumulate and should be properly disposed of.

#### GENERAL HEALTH AND WELLBIENG 7

#### 7.1 Purpose

a. The purpose of this section is to acquaint all members of crew and other personnel with information for their general well-being and health.\

{162}------------------------------------------------

b. HSEQA Dept will provide the vessels with guidelines, notices and guidance including personal health management as received and promulgated by the relevant medical authorities.

#### 7.2 Scope

The scope of this section addresses the dual topics of health and occupational hazards encountered on-board.

#### 7.3 Personal Responsibility

All personnel have an equal responsibility for their own well-being. If the vessel has a Medical Officer on board, he is responsible (reporting to the Master) for health matters on board. If the vessel does not have a Medical Officer, the Master assumes this responsibility.

#### 7.4 Medical Examination

- It is a Company policy that all Officers and crew should undergo an approved medical a. examination every two years or less.
- b. The medical examination will be carried out by the Company Medical Officer or other approved Physician at the expense of the Company.
- c. Officers and crew are responsible for ensuring their medical certificates are up to date. The officers and crew must have their original medical certificate with them onboard as required by regulations.

#### 7.5 Malaria Prevention

Precautions should be taken against the risk of contracting malaria when visiting certain countries. The Company provides anti-malaria tablets for vessels operating in malarial areas and it is the responsibility of all individuals to take these tablets as necessary. It is necessary to start taking anti-malaria precautions two weeks in advance of visiting malaria areas. Personnel appointed to ships in those areas should start taking precautions whilst on leave, in advance of travelling. The costs of malaria tablets required under these circumstances will be borne by the Company by reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. It should be borne in mind that some anti-malaria can have certain side effects and therefore the Company does not compulsorily require the taking of such medication.

#### 7.6 Vaccination Requirements

- a The Company may require personnel to receive Vaccinations and maintain Certificates for yellow fever and cholera. The yellow fever vaccination is valid for ten years; the cholera vaccination is valid for six months. Vaccination against typhoid, tetanus, polio, hepatitis "B" and other diseases may also be required.
- b. It must be borne in mind that some countries require that yellow fever vaccinations must be done at least 10 days before entry into that country is permitted.

#### Asbestos Hazards and Precautions 7.7

On some older Company vessels, there may still be small quantities of asbestos onboard. The subject of asbestos and its related hazards is now well documented from a multitude of industrial and inspectorate sources and which is freely available to Masters. An Asbestos Control Policy in the use of asbestos-based materials must be followed, and reliance is placed upon the Master, the Chief Engineer and the Safety Officer to maintain the safety of personnel when asbestos risks are present.

{163}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_163_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### 77.1 Ashestos Control

- a. Materials containing asbestos will only be removed by suitably trained and qualified operatives where it is found to be hazardous and is required to be removed for maintenance purposes. By definition the hazard will be presented in the form of flaking or friable material.
- ف Any replacement, modified or new structure will not include asbestos or asbestos containing material.
- c. Only if no adequate substitutes are available will the continued use of compound materials containing white asbestos be permitted in components of plant or machinery. In this event warning notices will be posted for personnel protection and information during maintenance or breakdown periods.

Note: Some state authorities apply even more stringent measures on the control and use of asbestos. Masters are advised to check with Head Office prior to commencement of charter.

#### 779 Health Hazards of Asbestos

- a. The main hazard of asbestos stems from airborne fibres in the form of visible and invisible dust caused by work on old insulation including electrical cable protection and the dismantling of any panelling behind which dust have accumulated,
- b. Inhalation of asbestos fibres and dustican lead to asbestosis, bronchial carcinoma (lung cancer) and mesothelioma, a rare but lethal tumour
- c. Additional risk is encountered by asbestos fibres penetrating the skin,

#### 773 Action on vessels

- a. The Master and Safety Officer should acquaint themselves with the places where there is asbestos or likely risk. Sound surfaces should not be probed or disturbed to ascertain whether asbestos is present.
- Any crewmember working in the probable vicinity of asbestos should liaise with the ف Safety Officer and specifically report any defects or deterioration in the condition of such material.
- Should an adverse report be indicated, the Master and Safety Officer should inspect the C. area immediately and adopt the following strategies.
- ರ. All crew and personnel should be informed and restriction of access applied to the area.
- e. If at all possible, the hazard area should be covered or sealed in order to reduce dust emission.
- f. Consider the abandonment of all work (if non-essential) until specialist shore-based operatives are able to attend.
- Report risk of airborne asbestos to Head Office. ರ
- Any member of crew or attendant personnel who has been exposed to asbestos dust ﮯ should be advised to make a record of dates and circumstances and to inform his local medical practitioner and Medical Officer of such exposure. The Master and Safety Officer are both required to submit comprehensive reports.
- Where repairs involving the dismantling of asbestos are undertaken by shore-based operatives, the repairer must be pre-informed of the nature and extent of any asbestos

{164}------------------------------------------------

work anticipated. It is essential that all airborne dust is contained within the work area and that fibres are not carried to other parts of the vessel by forced ventilation and extraction systems.

i. All modern new build vessels should be certified asbestos free and be issued with an Asbestos Free Certificate.

#### 77 4 Protection

- a. It is unlikely that the identification and proper monitoring of airborne asbestos can be effectively achieved onboard ship during periods of maintenance. Accordingly the following procedures should be adopted where no recourse to shore-based expertise is available.
- b. All attendant personnel must be given clear instruction in the proper use of protective clothing and equipment.
- Respiratory protective equipment and full protective clothing must be worn. The
  ပ respiratory equipment must meet the required minimum protection factor as required by International Standards. Clothing should comprise suitable footwear and pocket-less overalls, headgear and gloves, all manufactured from material capable of shedding dust. Overalls should be securely closed at the neck, ankles and wrists. Disposable overalls are acceptable provided they exclude asbestos dust.
- d. Respirators should be snug fitting to the face. Beards and spectacles will prevent most masks form fitting properly and therefore persons who cannot wear a close-fitting mask must either use a positive pressure respirator or keep away from areas of asbestos dust contamination.
- The Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) reserved for fire-fighting emergencies e. should not be used unless the asbestos dust is being caused by fire.
- f. Once work has commenced, the protective equipment and clothing must not be worn outside the area of contamination.
- g . When work is completed and areas tidied, the clothing and equipment should be freed of as much dust as possible using a specialised vacuum cleaner and its filters. NORMAL DOMESTIC/LIGHT INDUSTRIAL VACUUM CLEANERS MUST NOT BE USED.
- h. The vacuum cleaner should be cleaned before the protective clothing is removed. Clothing which is or was dust contaminated should be carefully removed and placed in a dust tight container (e.g. strong plastic bag sealed with adhesive tape) for eventual safe disposal ashore.
- i. Parts of the body exposed during the work should be thoroughly rinsed and washed again after removal of contaminated clothing.

# 7.7.5 Additional Safeguards

- Some important safeguards are necessary to ensure minimum cross-movement of a. asbestos dust. These include :
  - i. Thorough wetting of asbestos items.
  - Careful handling and the use of hand tools instead of powered tools. =
  - Controlled ventilation and the use of portable dust extraction equipment vented III. to safe areas.
  - The barring of access to all but essential personnel. iv.

{165}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_165_Picture_0.jpeg)

- Total enclosure of the working area by the use of plastic sheeting and adhesive v. sealing tape.
- Safe asbestos collection facilities such as a large plastic sheet which can vi. subsequently be sealed air tight.
- vii. Disposal of all contaminated items to ashore for specialist attention or laundry, all containers to be clearly labelled "Warning: Contains Asbestos" or "Asbestos Contaminated Clothing - Do Not Inhale the Dust".
- viii. The sealing of any remaining friable material by the use of suitable sealing compounds.

#### 7.8 Rabies Prevention

Rabies is a viral infection to which humans and all warm-blooded animals can succumb. The disease attacks the central nervous system to cause paralysis and convulsions (foaming at the mouth) and in humans is invariably fatal. The incubation period of human rabies is uncertain and any person exposed to rabies, normally through the bite of an animal, would be prescribed a course of unpleasant preventative injections. These injections are not always successful. The possession of shipboard pets/animals acquired overseas is absolutely forbidden due to the possible risk of rabies and other diseases. Furthermore, the importing of such animals will almost certainly be in breach of port state legislation is this respect.

#### 7.9 Bird Flu

Bird flu is a disease affecting birds that is caused by several types of flu viruses. Highly Pathogenic Bird Flu (HPAI) is a highly contagious disease affecting wild birds and poultry, and has been responsible for recent human outbreaks and deaths in Asian countries. Bird flu spreads to humans mainly through contact with infected birds, which shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions and faeces. Very rarely, inefficient and limited human-to-human transmission may occur.

#### Normal Seasonal Flu 7.10

Flu (Influenza) is an infection caused by a virus called the flu virus. It is usually a more severe illness than the common cold which is caused by other respiratory viruses. There are 3 main types of flu: flu A, flu B and flu C. Flu A and flu B are associated with annual outbreaks and epidemics. Flu A usually causes more severe illness than flu B and can result in pneumonia, hospitalization or even death, especially in the elderly and those with chronic illnesses. Flu A has also been responsible for all previous pandemics (worldwide epidemics of flu). Fiu C is very rarely seen and is associated with only mild sporadic illness.

#### Pandemic Flu 7.11

Pandemic flu occurs when a new flu virus emerges and starts spreading as normal flu (i.e. efficient human to-human transmission) - by coughing and sneezing. The new virus must be able to replicate in humans and cause serious illness. As the virus is new, the human immune system will have no pre-existing immunity. This makes it likely that that people who contract pandemic flu will experience more serious disease than that caused by normal flu.

# 7.12 Legionnaires Disease

The legionella bacteria lives and thrives in stagnant water or sludge or in cooling towers where wet material can be encrusted with scale or dirt or organic matter. It is considered that areas within the vessel's air conditioning system can present a breeding ground for such bacteria even with difference designs from those encountered ashore.

{166}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_166_Picture_0.jpeg)

The main danger areas are :

- a. air inlet arrangements
- b. filters
- cooler units (dehumidifiers) C.
- d. humidifiers
- e. plenum chambers

Regular maintenance and cleaning will reduce the level of risk from legionella and close attention to drainage provisions, filter overhaul in conjunction with super-chlorinated rinsing and the examination of insulating material within plenum chambers will be necessary. Frequency of cleaning will depend on specific system design and its susceptibility to fouling but should not exceed 3 month intervals.

#### 7.13 AIDS

- a. Much has been publicised on this topical subject and information is readily available. To summarise, AIDS is caused by a virus called HIV. This virus attacks the body's natural immune system which fights infections, and thereby lays the body open to opportunistic infections. At the present time, those who develop full blown AIDS will die from their illnesses. On current evidence approximately 30% of those infected will develop AIDS in the next five years.
- b. The HIV virus is present in body fluids such as blood, semen, saliva and tears. However, no-one is recorded having caught AIDS from saliva or tears.
- Two common avenues of viral transmission are vaginal and anal sexual intercourse and blood cross-infection. The more sexual partners the individual has the higher the risk of catching the virus. In many parts of the world and especially in Africa and South America the virus is prevalent. There are obvious risks in going with a prostitute. Always use a condom which will also reduce the possibility of other sexually transmitted diseases,
- d. Infection by drug abusers is known to be a major factor in the spread of the virus, whereby such drug misuse involve the sharing of drug paraphernalia (needles, syringes, mixing bowls, etc).
- e. Never use equipment for ear-piercing, tattooing or acupuncture unless it is absolutely certain that it is unused or sterilised. Don't share a tooth brush or razor - both items could transfer the virus through infected blood.

#### 7.14 Skin Care

- a. The skin provides natural protection so long as it remains intact and undamaged. However, the opening of skin pores and hair follicles, being a normal body function experienced onboard in warm climates or work areas, do present access to skin irritants. Heavy sweating, far from giving a dilution effect to soluble irritants, will make the skin sodden and thus less resistant to chemical or irritant agent attack.
- b. equally not all skin diseases are of occupational origin.
- All personnel are cautioned in the handling of hazardous substances. Proper ن preventative measures and personal protection advice must be strictly followed.
- d. Types of chemicals which will cause skin disease include contact irritants (acids, alkalis and organic solvents), contact sensitisers or allergens (nickel, chromates and rubber additives) and photo-sensitisers which require the stimulus of sun or U.V. light (coal tar pitch).

- e Additional agents which have proved the cause of skin disease include cutting oils, inorganic and organic chemicals, de-greasing agents, tar, pitch and other products of coal tar, physical agents including heat, light, humidity and ionising radiation, horticultural agents and dermatitis causing agents such as flour, sugar, cement dust, slurry and glass fibre.
- f. Always remember to don protective clothing and equipment prior to handling hazardous substances. Choose the correct item of clothing or equipment necessary for the work e.g. cotton gloves give little protection against liquids, many organic solvents will penetrate rubber (nitrile or neoprene), heavy PVC gloves cause loss of manual dexterity.
- Never rely on so-called barrier creams to effect skin protection. They are unlikely to be g. effective against allergic contact dermatitis. Emollient creams applied after skin cleansing help to replace the natural skin grease removed by degreasants or organic solvents.
- h. Prompt treatment of all wounds is essential since once the skin is broken, chemicals can penetrate to lower dermal levels and be readily absorbed into the body. All wounds should be dressed and re-dressed whilst the individual is at work.
- Personnel should note that although occupational dermatoses are not infectious or i. contagious a high standard of personal hygiene is most important in the combating of skin diseases. Contaminated clothing should be washed regularly or safely disposed of if washing is impracticable. Persons with a pre-history of skin ailments e.g. childhood eczema, should be especially prudent.
- j. When washing clothing, care must be taken to ensure that items are properly rinsed with fresh water to avoid skin problems due to detergent remaining in the clothing. Do not use excessive quantities of detergent and ensure the ship's washing machine is operated correctly.

#### 7.15 Heat Illness

The prevention of heat illness is a matter of common sense in keeping with normal day-to-day health precautions. Such illness can be simple sunburn, severe sunburn (peeling), dehydration, giddiness, vomiting and photophobia. In extreme circumstances the person can succumb to heat exhaustion which can be serious in the extreme. Precautions involve the ample replacement of body fluids by the intake of freshwater, body protection against extremes of heat and the taking of adequate salt tablets or salt with food. Abstinence or the limited intake of alcohol is recommended in high ambient temperature areas.

#### 7.16 Sun Light Exposure Risks

The publicised risks of overexposure to sunlight (U.V.) for holidaymakers also apply to personnel working in tropical conditions on decks. Never regard the working on deck as a side benefit for the purposes of obtaining a tan. Risks such as malignant melanoma, skin cancer and changes of appearance to moles and other skin blemishes are becoming all too common. Always cover up and wear the work clothes provided.

# 7.17 Eye Damage from Light Exposure

- Optical radiation is another term for light, covering ultraviolet (UV) radiation, visible light, a. and infrared radiation. The greatest risks to health are probably posed by:
- b. JV radiation from the sun. Exposure of the eyes to UV radiation can damage the cornea and produce pain and symptoms similar to that of sand in the eye. When working in strong sunlight personnel should use approved safety glasses that also provide protection from sunlight or some other form of shading of the eyes. Never look directly at the sun with binoculars or telescope.

{168}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_168_Picture_0.jpeg)

- The misuse of powerful lasers. High-power lasers can cause serious damage to the eye c. (including blindness) as well as producing skin burns.
- Exposure to electric Arc-welding. Unprotected exposure to arc-welding can cause "arc-Gi eye" where the retina of the eye can become permanently damaged. Never look directly at the arc without using appropriate welding eye protections.

#### 7.18 Noise

One of the most common industrial ailments is noise-induced hearing loss. In compliance with statutory codes of practice, the Company provides suitable ear protection equipment and the compulsory wearing should be strictly enforced. Admittance to engine spaces and other areas of high noise exposure is to be denied to persons not equipped with ear protection.

#### 7.19 Dust Inhalation

All precautions against the inhalation of dust e.g. whilst cleaning bulk tanks, should be taken. Dust or respirator masks must be worn. Filter elements should be changed regularly and masks cleaned at the end of each working cycle. Damaged or unserviceable equipment should be brought to the attention of the Safety Officer for immediate replacement.

#### 8 HYGIENE

- d. Galley staff should bear in mind that cooking oil, when heated to high temperatures, can suddenly burst into flames without any additional source of ignition, hence the requirement for thermostatically controlled deep fryers with lids.
- Any malfunction of galley equipment that is defective in its parts, guards or safety e. e. devices should be reported to the Chief Engineer and taken out of service with power disconnected until properly repaired. The malfunctioning equipment should also be locked/tagged out indicating the unserviceable condition.

#### 8.9 Sharp Utensils

- a. Sharp utensils should not be left lying around where someone may accidentally cut themselves. They should not be mixed in with other items for washing up but cleaned individually and should be stored in secured racks or sheaths when not in use.
- b. Chopping foodstuffs requires undivided attention. The chopping board must be firm, the cutting area of the foodstuff well on the chopping block and hands and body clear of the line of strike. There must be adequate room for movement and no obstructions in to the cutting stroke. Particular care is required when the vessel in underway and/or when other personnel are in the vicinity.
- c. When chopping or cutting foodstuffs during preparation, personnel must wear protective cut resistant gloves.

# 8.10 Refrigerator Spaces and Store Rooms

- a. Refrigerator spaces are to be the subject of regular inspection and cleaning. The periods of defrosting will be assessed by pre-planning according to ice development and storage rotation determined by vessel movements and food quality, condition and shelf life.
- All refrigerated room doors are fitted with means of opening the door and of sounding the alarm from the inside. A routine testing of the alarm bell and checking of the door clasps and inside release should be carried out regularly, at least at weekly intervals.
- All stores and crates should be stowed securely so that they do not shift or move at sea. င့္မွ
- d. All refrigerated room doors should be able to be secured open while stores are being handled. The doors are extremely heavy and can cause serious injury to a person caught between the door and the door frame.
- All stores and crates should be stowed securely so that they do not shift or move in e. seaway.
- f. When stores are received onboard, as far as possible cartons and other packaging should not be brought inside the accommodation as cockroaches can be living in the packaging materials. The contents should be unpacked on deck and the individual items brought inside for storage.
- g In the event of vermin infestation becoming apparent on board, the Master must be advised immediately and he will arrange with the Technical Superintendent to arrange for pest control measures to be taken as soon as possible.

#### 8.11 Food Wastes

a Garbage or food wastes should not be allowed to build up in the galley and/or messrooms.

{172}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_172_Picture_0.jpeg)

- ف Proper garbage containers and bags should be provided so that garbage can be stored hygienically and segregated in accordance with their contents and the requirements of the Garbage Management Plan. The containers should clearly indicate the content of the garbage.
- Garbage should be regularly transferred to a designated location outside the ن accommodation where it can be segregated and safely stored. Means shall be provided to cover the garbage to prevent it from being disturbed.
- d. As far as possible, garbage awaiting disposal should be securely stored outside of ship's accommodation well away from vents and blower suctions.
- e. Garbage, including food waste, must be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of the Garbage Management Plan.

#### 8.12 Shower Cubicles and Toilets

- a. It is each individual's responsibility to ensure the showers are rinsed and toilets flushed after use. All shower cubicles and toilets are to be the subject of regular cleaning and disinfection. Shower screens or curtains must be regularly wiped down. Shower roses must be regularly dismantled and cleaned.
- b. Toilet bowls and seats including the hinge mechanisms must be cleaned with disinfectant solution at least once a week.
- c. Shower heads and flexible hoses, where fitted, should be thoroughly cleaned in 50ppm chlorine solution routinely every 3 months.

#### 8.13 Freshwater Tank and Supplies

In order to reduce the possibility of bacterial infection or toxic ingestion the following procedures should be closely followed:

- a Loading and Supply Arrangements. Only hoses designated for freshwater purposes shall be used and marked as such. They are to be flushed through before use and discharged to waste. Hoses must be drained after use and properly stored in clean areas.
- b. Treatment. When taking in fresh water in some parts of the world, bear in mind that treatment of the water may be necessary.
- c. Freshwater from Evaporators or Reverse Osmosis Plant. The output from such water producing plants must only be stored when the vessel is at least 20 miles from land or away from estuarial pollution risk which can extend well in excess of 20 miles.
- d. Storage Tanks. All freshwater tanks should be emptied, opened up, ventilated and inspected at regular intervals. The tanks should be thoroughly cleaned and recoated as necessary. PTW for confined space must be carried out and enforced prior to entry.
- Fresh Water Distribution System. The various elements of freshwater distribution should e. be the subject of inspection and maintenance according to the vessel's Planned Maintenance System requirements.
- f. Water Filtration System. Most of the Company Fleet has been or will be fitted with water purification systems.
- g. In order to maintain their effectiveness, such systems need to be regularly maintained as required in the Planned Maintenance System.

{173}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_173_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### 8.14 Work Clothes

- Frequent washing of work clothes is a major factor in the reduction of cross-infections a. and skin ailments. Never allow the work clothes to be saturated by industrial dirt, oils, greases or hazardous substances. Always remove such clothing immediately should contamination occur, wash using washing powder (NOT solvents, dispersants, degreasers, diesel, etc) and fully rinsed using fresh water. When washing work clothes in washing machines and drying using tumble dryers, ensure the manufacturer's instructions are properly followed and the machines are not overloaded.
- b. If the work clothes cannot be properly cleaned or are in poor condition, they should be properly disposed of and replaced.
- c. The Company maintains a policy in excess of statutory requirements for the provision of protective clothing and equipment and therefore does not condone the wearing or usage of sub-standard or dirty protective clothing. All crew members have a responsibility to maintain such clothing to normal industrial cleanliness standards.

# 8.15 On-board Inspections

The Master has the full authority of management to inspect all parts of the vessel at least weekly, as required by MLC '06. This inspection will include all working, storage, recreational, living, sleeping, laundry and lavatory spaces occupied by the vessel's complement, the ship's hospital and any facilities used/occupied by other temporary personnel (including Charter's personnel), No one person has the right for objection since the Master, as Owners representative, is required by both International and Flag State legislation to ensure hygienic facilities are afforded to the welfare of all.

#### Pests - Control and Prevention 9.0

#### 9.1 Safe Use of Pesticides

- a. The Master's attention is drawn to the fact that the development of new pesticides has lead to increasing concern with regard to pest-control operations onboard ships in general. These concerns have necessitated the issue of revised recommendations.
- b. In particular, some of the gases and agents in common use for fumigation are flammable and must only be used strictly in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. All recommended fumigants are highly toxic and must only be applied by qualified operatives.
- The Master must ensure all safeguards are taken to minimise risk to on-board personnel ن during pest control and fumigation operations.

#### 9.2 Vermin Infestation

In the event of vermin infestation becoming apparent on board, the Master must be advised immediately and he will arrange with the Technical Superintendent to arrange for pest control measures to be taken as soon as possible.

#### 9.3 Control of Rodents:

9.3.1 Rats on ships are a menace to health and a nuisance; they cause extensive damage to cargo and food and are carrier to diseases. As rats usually roam around galley and food storage areas, they can introduce disease organism into food and water supplies. Rats also carry fleas, which can transmit plague and typhus fever. Vessels infested with rats must be fumigated, though it can be avoided through preventive anti rat measures including proper cleanliness and frequent inspection.

{174}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_174_Picture_0.jpeg)

- 9.3.2 Despite precautions, by the ship personnel and port authorities, some rats may still be able to find their way on board either through cargo or ship stores. However, they can eliminate them by ensuring that they do not have access to food and that there are no suitable nesting place for them and also by placing rat traps.
- 9.3.3 To keep a ship relatively free of rats, following steps should be taken :
  - a. Prevent them on getting onboard by placing and maintaining rat guards on all mooring lines and keeping the gangway well lit and guarded.
  - b. The stores and cargo received shall be checked and accommodation doors closed to prevent their entry where it is known that rats exist.
  - Rat proof the ship by eliminating hidden and dead spaces where they can hide, keeping the ship in good shape, preventing garbage area, cargo, boxes, dunnage and other movable equipments from providing temporary shelter.
  - d. Do not provide the survival food to rats by keeping all food and garbage stored in metal containers with tightly fitted metal covers.
  - e. Avoid the accumulation of food scraps and clean up spilled food or edible waste on regular interval.
- 9.3.4 To eliminate rats, take following steps:
  - Set snap traps, cages along the route used as rat runs. a.
  - Use baits i.e. meat, bacon, cheese, apple, pears, dates, ﻋ
  - Use rat poison, note that these chemicals are poisonous to man too, keep them in ပ original containers with label and store away from food.
  - d. Use bait trays for poison as it will not get scattered and can be removed easily, crew handling rat poisons should wear gloves and wash their hands carefully after laying baits.
  - If the ship is badly infested, then fumigation is the best method to eliminate rats. The e. operations should be carried out by experts from authorised agencies. The gases used for fumigation are hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide; they are extremely poisonous to human.
- 9.3.5 If the fumigation is carried out on board then following procedures are to be carried out:
  - a. Before fumigation, the vessel has to be tied up at a distance from other vessels.
  - ﻀ Ensure crew removed and only fumigation team on board.
  - c. After fumigation ventilate accommodation thoroughly.
  - ರ. Beds and clothing to be thoroughly aired on deck for at least 2 hours.
  - Destroy any food that has been exposed to fumigation. e.
  - f Test for gas after an hour of ventilation.
  - Do not enter fumigated area until certified by officer in charge of fumigation. g.

#### 9 4 Control of Insects.

9.4.1 Flies and mosquitoes may board the vessel at wharves or in the harbour or in offshore locations. Bedbugs, fleas, lice may be brought on the bodies, clothing or personal gear of crew or passenger, fleas may also be carried by rats. Cockroaches may be present in provisions or in cargo brought aboard ship. Insects occasionally transmit bacterial infection when germs on their bodies come in contact with food or other articles. The suppression of insect infestation requires

{175}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_175_Picture_0.jpeg)

coordination between ship and shore personnel. Unless control efforts are continued at sea, the efforts to eliminate them in port will fail. It is easier and less costly to maintain constant controls onboard than to apply intensive cleaning measures only in port, continual control measures at sea will have long lasting effects and will also improve living and working condition on board.

- 9.4.2 Knowledge of habits on each type of insect is essential for prevention, control and elimination:
  - a. Body lice live on the human body and clothing; personal cleanliness will reduce the risk of infestation
  - b. Bedbugs seek shelter in cracks in walls and floors around beds, cleanliness and frequent inspection are essential.
  - c. Cockroaches breed wherever food is available, so strict cleanliness is essential wherever food is stored, prepared and/or eaten.
  - d. Flies are attracted to unprotected food and refuse, avoid unnecessary exposure of food and place refuse in clean, tightly covered cans for prompt disposal.
- 9.4.3 Personal cleanliness and cleanliness of the living and working environment are vital to keeping insect population to a minimum. Insecticides provide short term relief and are of little long term value if unsanitary conditions persist. Insecticides also contaminate drink, food, or surfaces used for food preparation and some of them are flammable in nature. Only properly trained staff should be allowed to use insecticides, which must be stored in such a way as to prevent the insecticides from being stolen or picked up by accident.
- 9.4.4 Housefies are a nuisance and may transmit disease if they have access to faeces and food. The following guidelines are useful to eliminate flies and prevent any disease:
  - a. Store all refuse in durable cans with tight lids.
  - b. Use chemical sprays sparingly (i.e. fly kill aerosols).
  - C. Screen windows and doors if possible.
  - ಕ Scheduled disinfection of garbage storage areas and drums, preferably on weekly basis
- 9.4.5 Several species of mosquito bite humans and may transmit malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and other diseases, following steps should be taken to prevent and eliminate them :
  - Remove all potential receptacles or containers of standing water. a.
  - Keep insect screen on windows and doors if possible. b.
  - Use insect repellent lotion on exposed skin when working in mosquito infested areas or C. ports.
- 9.4.6 Cockroaches are often a indication of sub standard cleaning and food storage but do not normally transmit disease. The below steps shall be carried out to control cockroaches :
  - a. Eliminate cracks, crevices, and dead spaces.
  - Eliminate sources of moisture by repairing leaking taps and covering plug holes, ﻘ
  - Store food and garbage properly. C.
  - ರ. Keep the entire vessel clean.

- Watch for and destroy all cockroaches and their egg cases, especially those introduced e. with luggage, food stores and furniture.
- f -Where practicable, unpack cardboard boxes and cartons out on deck and transfer the 'items to the provision stores as soon as possible, thereby avoiding bringing the boxes / cartons inside the accommodation.
- Use enclosed bait stations or gels, traps in food storage and preparation areas. ಧ.
- h. In other areas use the appropriate spray to eliminate cockroaches.
- 9.4.7 Bedbugs are common throughout the world, especially in tropical and sub tropical areas and in economically weaker countries. They do not live in beds but in cracks and crevices around walls and roofs. They bite humans while asleep, most often just before dawn, and are rarely seen by humans. The bite cause itching, swelling, redness of skin, and can become infected. The following steps should be taken to prevent bedbugs on vessels :
  - Hot wash or dry clean bedclothes, or place them in plastic bag and then in a freezer for a. 24 hours.
  - b. Early in the day use a insecticide to spray on cracks in bulkhead and floors, bed bases, mattresses and furniture.
  - Dry insecticide treated mattresses and cover them with sheets before re-use C.

Note that bedbugs do not usually transmit diseases and, to relieve itching if bitten, apply the appropriate cream

#### 9.5 Inspection for Infestations

- Regular inspections are necessary to detect early signs of infestation and so that action a. can be taken accordingly. Master's must check the vessel for any of the above infestations during the weekly inspection.
- b. Frequent reminders and awareness training to ship staff will keep them aware of the need to maintain the vessel in clean condition.
- c. Master's are reminded to request for shore assistance if the infestation is beyond their control and specialist support is needed.

#### 10. SLIPS, TRIPS AND FALLS

- 10.1 Suitable footwear, preferably with slip-resistant soles, should be worn at all times. A large proportion of injuries to crews arise because they wear unsuitable footwear such as sandals, plimsolls or flip-flops, which do not grip greasy decks or protect the feet from burns or scalds if hot or boiling liquids are spilt.
- 10.2 Decks, and particularly stairs, should be regularly maintained so that cracks and worn areas do not cause a trip hazard.
- 10.3 Decks and gratings should be kept clear from grease, rubbish and unused tools etc to avoid slipping. Any spillage should be cleared up immediately.
- 10.4 The area of deck immediately outside the entrance to accommodation should have an anti-slip surface.
- 10.5 Care should always be taken when using stairs and companionways; one hand should always be kept free to grasp the handrail.

{177}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_177_Picture_0.jpeg)

- 10.6 Trays, crates, cartons etc should not be carried in such fashion that sills, storm steps or other obstructions in the path are obscured from view.
- 10.7 Lifts that involve reaching up too high or too low should be avoided. Personnel should not stand on unsecured objects to reach articles which are out of reach.
- 10.8 Personnel are reminded to take care as they move about the ship. In particular, the following points, though obvious, are all too often overlooked :
  - Personnel should watch out for tripping hazards, and protrusions such as pipes, framing of a. etc:
  - The possibility of a sudden or heavy roll of the ship should always be borne in mind; 0.
  - Suitable footwear should be worn which will protect toes against accidental stubbing and ن falling loads, and will afford a good hold on deck and give firm support while using ladders; extra care should be taken when using ladders whilst wearing sea boots;
  - d. It is dangerous to swing on or vault over stair rails, guard-rails or pipes;
  - Injuries are often caused by jumping off hatches etc; e.
  - Manholes and other deck accesses should be kept closed when not being used; guardf. rails should be erected and warning signs posted when they are open;
  - Spillage of oil, grease, soapy water etc, should be cleaned up as soon as practicable; g.
    တွေ
  - Areas made slippery by snow lice or water should be treated with sand or some other h. suitable substance;
  - i. The presence of temporary obstacles should be indicated by appropriate warning signs;
  - j. Litter and loose objects, e.g. tools, should be cleared up;
  - k. Wires and ropes should be coiled and stowed;
  - ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ Lifelines should be rigged securely across open decks in rough weather;
  - Ladders should be secured and ladder steps kept in good condition; care should be m. taken when using ladders and gangways providing access to or about the vessel, particularly when wearing gloves;
  - Means of access to fire fighting equipment, emergency escape routes and watertight n. doors should never be obstructed.
- 10.9 All deck surfaces used for transit about the ship and all passageways, walkways and stairs must be properly maintained and kept free from substances liable to cause a person to slip or fall.
- 10.10 Suitable hand-holds should be provided at the top and at any intermediate landing place of all fixed ladders.
- 10.11 Protection from falls
  - a. All personnel who are working aloft, outboard or below decks or in any other area where there is a risk of falling more than two metres, should wear a safety harness attached to a lifeline.

{178}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_178_Picture_0.jpeg)

- b. Permit to work system and risk assessment should be carried out before working aloft.
- C. If a vessel is shipping frequent seas, nobody should be required to work on deck unless absolutely necessary.
- - However, where this is unavoidable, persons on deck should wear a harness and, where d. practicable, should be secured by lifeline as a protection from falls and from being washed overboard or against the ship's structure.

#### 11. GUIDELINES ON USE OF PORTABLE ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT

#### 11.1 General

Power operated equipment may be dangerous unless properly maintained, handled and used and should only be used by competent persons.

The flexible cables of electric tools should comply with the relevant International standard. Before work begins, personnel should ensure that power supply leads are in good condition laid safely & do not obstruct passage.

The risk of electric shock is increased by perspiration and locations which are damp, humid or have large conductive surfaces.

Accessories and tool pieces should be absolutely secure in the tool. They should not be changed when the tool is connected to a source of power.

Grinding discs and rotary brushes must be of the correct type and must only be fitted by competent personnel.

Correct safety guards should be securely fixed to appliances requiring them and should be checked for security before starting any operation. Such guards should only be removed when the equipment is not operating and isolated from the power source.

During temporary interruptions to work and on completion of tasks, equipment should be isolated from power sources and left safely or stowed away correctly.

Electrical tools should not be used on open decks which can cause spark and lead to fire when working near a platform or FPSO or in area where flammable vapour and gases might be present.

Personal protective equipment should be worn as appropriate (e.g. eye, face and hearing protection).

Since ships are largely made of metal, which conducts electricity, great care should be taken in the use of electrical equipment. Permit to work system to be followed as applicable on the nature of operation.

#### Guidelines 11.2

# INSTRUCTIONS

Read and follow all labels and the Owner's Manual carefully before installing, operating, or servicing unit. Read the safety information at the beginning of the manual and in each section.

Use only genuine replacement parts from the manufacturer.

Perform maintenance and service according to the Owner's Manuals, industry standards.

{179}------------------------------------------------

Work in a confined space only if it is well ventilated. Always have a trained watchperson nearby, Fumes, gases, and particles can displace air and lower the oxygen level causing injury or death. Be sure the breathing air is safe.

Do not work in locations near degreasing, cleaning, or spraying operations.

Do not work on materials that may contain hazardous substances, including items with leadbased paint. Coatings and any materials containing these elements can give off toxic fumes, gases, and particles when worked on.

# SPARKS can cause fire or explosions

Check and be sure the area is safe before doing any work.

Sparks can fly off from the equipment. The flying sparks, hot work piece, and hot equipment can cause fires and burns. Accidental contact with metal objects can cause sparks, explosion, overheating, or fire.

Remove all flammables within 10 m of the equipment. If this is not possible, tightly cover them with approved covers.

Do not work on containers that have held combustibles or on closed containers such as tanks, drums, or pipes unless they are properly inspected for residuals.

Do not work where flying sparks can strike flammable material. Protect yourself and others from flying sparks and hot metal.

Be alert that sparks and hot materials can easily go through small cracks and openings to adjacent areas.

Watch for fire, and keep a fire extinguisher nearby.

Do not work where the atmosphere may contain flammable dust, gas, or liquid vapour, within 500 mtrs of offshore platform or near FPSO

Wear oil-free protective garments such as boiler suits, safety shoes, and helmet.

Remove any combustibles, such as butane lighter or matches, from your pockets before doing any work.

After completion of work, inspect area to ensure it is free of sparks, glowing embers, and flames.

Use only correct fuses or circuit breakers. Do not oversize or bypass them.

Follow requirements for hot work (permit/Risk Assessment) and have a fire watcher and extinguisher nearby.

# Flying metal-dirt-sparks can injure eyes

Welding, chipping, wire brushing and grinding cause sparks and flying metal. As welds cool, they can throw off slag. Wear approved safety glasses with side shields even under your welding helmet.

Wear a face shield to protect eyes and face. Operate equipment with proper guards, and in a safe location while wearing proper face, and body protection.

Sparks can cause fires - keep flammables away.

#### 5.7 Crew Passports

The handling of Crew Passports must be very stringently controlled when there are requests from Agents asking to take these documents ashore. If possible, it is preferable that these documents remain on board at all times, but if they have to be sent ashore, the landing Form in IMS 11A Appendix B, shall be used and the purpose of landing is clearly identified. A signed acknowledgement shall be taken from the Agent before they are handed over .This Form is also to be used to advise the Operations department that these documents have been handed over, thereby ensuring that the Office can also keep track as well as assist, if the need arises. In cases where the Master does not feel comfortable to hand over the Passports he should withhold them and immediately inform and take direction from Office.

#### 5.8 Carriage of Passengers on Board

Carriage of passengers onboard our fleet vessels are only after master's consideration and appraisal of the following:-

- a) Total complement of crew and passengers does not go beyond the vessel's LSA/FFA capacity as stated on the vessel's Safety Equipment certification
- b) There is sufficient accommodation space for all crew and intended passengers, prior to departure from the port or installation
- c) Total number of passengers onboard the vessel does not exceed 12; else the vessel is in serious contravention of SOLAS regulations, not being a passenger vessel.
- d) Vessel with SPS (Special Purpose Ship) code notation may exceed 12 passengers in line with their class certification.

SR MARINE Semco Crewing, Technical, HSEQA and Operations departments must always be kept advised on the carriage of passengers, with full passenger details of name / nationality and passport numbers. This is besides date & port / installation of embarkation and disembarkation. These passenger details must be sent as a separate email, to ensure that this is properly highlighted.

These services are chargeable to charterers, and accurate records must be maintained and sent to the Operations Department so that necessary invoicing can be raised to the charterers.

This may be a chargeable service, therefore it is necessary for the Master to ensure the following: -

- a) A clean cabin and serviceable toilet is provided to the passengers
- b) Clean linen, towel & soap is provided
- c) Any other essentials must be carried by the passengers & can be declined if requested,

The Chief Officer is responsible, under the Master's guidance, to ensure and monitor cleanliness standards of the cabins provided to the passengers, and is to utilise the services of the catering department, with very clear instructions on the cleanliness standards required for the carriage.

The SR MARINE Visitor Indemnity Form must be signed by all passengers being carried onboard the vessel, a scanned copy of which must be forwarded to the Operations Department.

- 1. The aim of this checklist is to ensure that all new shorebased staff undergo an effective induction into SR MARINE FLEET SERVICES (PFS). The extent of the induction shall be dependent on the designation and job specification of the new staff, likewise Supervisor/HOD shall determine whether all other new staff need to complete the entire induction or selected aspects depending on their job specifications.
- 2. It is the responsibility of the staff providing the induction and the Supervisor/HOD to ensure that the new staff member receives a comprehensive and relevant induction program when they join PFS.
- The new staff member must be familiarised within the company premises (base layout) prior 3. to the commencement of the Induction Program. This will ensure that helshe is familiarised with the evacuation procedures, or specific safety requirements in his/her work area.
- 4. The induction checklist has been created to be sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of the individual and the department. Additional space has been allocated for departmental specific requirements.
- 5. If any boxes are left incomplete at the end of the induction, it is the responsibility of the new staff member and the inducting staff to bring it to the attention of the person involved in assisting with that particular task.

#### 1. PURPOSE

- The purpose of completing an Accident/Incident/Near-Miss Report Form is to document what 1.1. has occurred and to report it to Company Management.
- 1.2. The purpose of carrying out an Accident/Incident/Near-Miss Investigation is to discover how and why an accident/incident occurred and to facilitate whatever action is necessary to minimise the possibility of re-occurrence.
- 1.3. In short, an Accident/Incident/Near-Miss Report Form documents the "what happened" and the "where it happened" - the Accident/Incident Investigation Form documents the "how it happened", the "why it happened" and the "action taken to prevent re-occurrence".
- 1.4. The purpose of reporting of non-conformances (NC's) is so that corrective and preventative action can be taken and so they can be investigated and analysed.

#### SCOPE つ

- After any serious accident, incident or near-miss, a HSE Meeting must be held on board to 2.1. discuss what happened and to initiate the reporting and investigation.
- 2.2. All accidents, incidents and near-misses must be reported immediately to the appropriate Operations Department and the HSEQA Department.
- 2.3. All incidents, accidents and near misses shall be investigated.
- 2.4. This Accident/Incident Investigation Form is intended to document the investigation and it must be accompanied by a completed Accident/Incident Report Form.
- 2.5. The Accident/Incident Investigation Form is designed to assist in identifying the immediate and underlying root causes of an accident or incident, as well as documenting the immediate and long term actions taken/to be taken to prevent re-occurrence.
- 2.6. On completion of the investigation, the Master may also consider holding a "safety standdown" on board (subject to Charterer's approval), at which the findings and corrective / preventative actions can be disseminated to the Officers and Crew.

#### 3. RESPONSIBILITY

- 3.1. It is the responsibility of the Master to carry out an Accident/Incident Investigation and to complete and submit the Form (and the Accident or Incident Report Form) to Company Management.
- 3.2. It is also the responsibility of the Master to ensure appropriate immediate and long term action is taken to prevent or minimise the possibility of re-occurrence.
- 3.3. If the severity of the accident, incident or near-miss warrants it, the Company Management will implement its own Investigation and take long-term remedial action as appropriate to prevent or minimise the possibility of re-occurrence.
- 3.4. It is the responsibility of the DPA/HSEQA Department to verify the appropriate action has been taken and to "close out" the investigation.

#### র্ব BASIC SAFETY TERMINOLOGY

- 4.1. Incident . An undesirable event that causes or has the potential to cause:
  - Harm to people Damage to property a. C.
  - Operational loss b. Harm to environment ರ್

- 4.2. Accident'. An undesirable event that causes the death, injury or incapacity of a person.
- 4.3. Near Miss. A sequence of events and/or conditions that did not result in a loss due to a fortuitous break in the chain of events and/or conditions. The potential loss could be human fatality, environmental damage or negative business impact (e.g. repair or replacement costs, off hire, loss of reputation)
- 4.4; Unsafe Act (also known as BBS Observation). Any act by a person or persons that could result in injury to personnel or damage to the equipment. Crew are encouraged to report any such acts through BBS observation to prevent potential injury or damage to equipment.
- 4.5. Unsafe Condition (also known as HAZOBS). Any condition of either the vessel, equipment on board the vessel or in the activities being carried out by the vessel that could result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.
- 4.6. Immediate Cause. Usually due to acts or mistakes by individuals or equipment failure. In a typical incident / accident / near-miss, there could be multiple immediate causes. Immediate cause is not deep enough to be a root cause. Examples of immediate cause:
  - a.
  - ض Human errors that caused an incident / accident to occur, or allowed the consequences of the incident / accident to be worse than they might have been.
- 4.7. Root Cause. The absence, neglect, or deficiencies of management systems are fundamentally the root causes of incident. For a typical incident / accident, there is at least one root cause. Examples of root causes are as follows :
- 4.7.1. Personal Factors
  - Physical capabilities / conditions a.
  - b. Attitude
  - C. Behaviour
  - ರ Skill level
- 472 Job Factors
  - a. Inadequate Training / knowledge
  - b. Management / supervision / leadership
  - C. Management oversight
  - ರ. Engineering / design
  - e. Poor / No Procedure
  - f. Procedure not followed
- 4.8 identify the management failure and what changes need to be made in the management systems to prevent recurrence.
- 4.9 Immediate Corrective Action (Correction): A correction is any action that is taken to eliminate a nonconformity or undesirable situation. Correction is like first-aid, its the instant action that is taken to correct the nonconformity or to reduce the impact of nonconformity that has occurred.
- 4.10 Corrective Action (CA): Corrective actions are steps that are taken to remove the causes of an existing nonconformity or undesirable situation. Corrective action will target the root cause so that the non-conformity or undesirable situation does not re-occur (on same sight/vessel). Corrective Action can be considered as a 'Problem Solving'.

4.11 Preventive Action (PA): Preventive actions are steps that are taken to remove the causes of potential nonconformities or potential situations that are undesirable. Preventive actions are taken to prevent occurrence of similar non-conformity or undesirable situation on other sights/vessels of the fleet. Preventive action is like Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) or · risk management. Where the non-conformity or undesirable situation have not actually occurred. We need to anticipate the risks or un-desirable situation that may occur and than think of actions that shall eliminate the cause of non-conformity.

#### PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING & INVESTIGATING ACCIDENTS/INCIDENT 5.

- 5.1. All accidents, incidents or near-misses must be immediately reported by the Master to the appropriate Operations Department and the DPA/HSEQA Department. The initial reporting shall be done through telephone call to appraise the office on nature and severity of the incident/accident and near miss. The respective reports shall be sent as per the time stipulated in the report (Accident report- within 6 hrs, Incident and Near Miss report- within 12 hrs).
- 5.2. Accident prevention requires the identification and elimination of unnecessary and unacceptable risks in operations. The reporting of accidents/incidents and near-misses help to identify system weaknesses and high-risk areas. Highlighting such areas allows the development of defences against risks or the making of improvements to weak areas. Any failure to report accidents, incidents or near-misses may allow weaknesses and risks to remain hidden in the system, resulting in possible re-occurrence,

#### ACCIDENTS/INCIDENTS/NEAR-MISS INVESTIGATION 6.0

- 6.1 The purpose of an accident/incident/near-misses investigation is to identify the immediate and root causes in order that action can be taken to prevent reoccurrence, and to benefit from the lessons learnt. It is not to assess blame, nor is it solely to establish a single or primary cause.
- 6.2 Without investigation, many questions would go unanswered, prevention measures could not be developed, and personnel would be likely to make the same mistakes again.
- 6.3 Few accidents/incidents/near-misses result from a single cause. Very commonly, a sequence of events occurs, the elimination of any one of which could have prevented the accident/incident/near-miss. Therefore, to prevent future occurrences, it is imperative that all cause factors be determined.
- 6.4 An incomplete or inadequate investigation resulting in erroneous conclusions nullifies completely the only possible benefit which could be derived from an accident/incident.
- 6.5 When an accident, incident or near-miss has occurred, Master has to establish an Investigation Team in order to identify the causal factors, intermediate causes, and root causes of an incident and develops recommendations to address each level of the analysis.
- 6.6 The Investigation Team requirements are vary based on the incident's classification. Each incident investigation team should meet the following minimum composition requirements:
  - At least one person knowledgeable in the process or activity involved
  - A team leader and/or others with appropriate knowledge and skills to thoroughly Investigate and analyse the event.

- 6.7.1 Investigation Team Responsibilities The investigation team follows the basic investigation procedure outlined in the company incident investigation form. The investigation team is responsible for the following:
  - Completing the investigation as soon as possible
  - Documenting the results, including recommendations
  - Submitting the report to DPA for review, distribution, and communication.
- 6.7.2 Team Leader The investigation team leader is responsible for assigning team member responsibilities, Leading the brainstorming activities, completing the investigation report and informing the effected employees. He also responsible for communicating additional resource required (e.g. expertise) to company management when necessary to properly conduct the investigation.
- 6.7.3 Develop Incident Statement The personnel involved in the event will often not remember the details of the event, including their own actions. The information asked of them to remember is usually not required for the normal performance of their duties. So, there is little reason for them to pay attention to the details typically being asked during an investigation. In most cases, the raw data is needed from personnel: what they saw, what they heard and so on. Investigators are supposed to draw conclusion from the data collected. Please use Witness Statement Form (IMS 07, appendix F) in order to record down their statements. 2
- 6.7.4 Gathering Information This process involves gathering information related to the event(s) in order to understand what occurred. Note that the level of effort should be greater for events with greater actual or potential losses.

- 6.7.5 Develop a timeline A chronological sequence of events that starts on deviation from normal conditions and ends on return to normal conditions.
- 6.7.6 Determining Causal Factors Identifying root causes is one of the main goals of the incident investigation process, but it is heavily dependent on finding the causal factors. Root cause identification should not be started until the causal factors have been identified. Develop an understanding of the causes of the event by using the fault tree (why tree or causal factor chart).
- 6.7.7 I Identifying the Root Causes For each causal factor, it must be determined why the causal factor existed or occurred. This usually leads to identification of missing, failed or inadequate management systems. These are root cause identification should not begin until all of the causal factors are determined. Jumping to root cause identification before the incident is understood and causal factors are identified may result in:
  - Developing the wrong recommendations
  - Developing ineffective recommendations
  - Recurrence of the incident

It is important to verify that the root causes meet the criteria for a root cause by using the causal factor, root cause and recommendation as given in IMS 07 - Appendix C.

6.7.8 Developing Recommendations - Recommendation are the most important products of the investigation. In addition to addressing the higher-level causes of an incident, recommendation should also address system improvement aimed at a problem's root causes.

| Authorised By | Director PFS       |

Recommendations are developed after the data analysis and identification of underlying causes are completed.

Recommendation should be directly tied to causal factors and their underlying causes. Implementing a recommendation should eliminate the causal factors and the underlying root causes. Therefore, it should inhibit and disrupt the sequence of events that led to the loss event.

Most recommendations do not have to be implemented in the short term to continue with operations. For example, a recommendation suggests making improvements to the design development process or a change in the way that purchasing is performed to ensure that the equipment and parts used by the vessel meet appropriate safety, environmental or quality standards. These are good ideas for the long-term operation of the equipment, but they usually do not have to be implemented to ensure proper operation today. As a result, recommendations need to be assigned to someone along with a specific date for completion. The company will also need someone to periodically review the list of unresolved recommendations to keep their implementation on schedule. In most cases, the person who will implement the recommendation is not the person who wrote it. Therefore, the recommendation must clearly state what should be accomplished so that it is carried out as intended.

6.7.9 Reporting - Team leader is responsible for ensuring that, at the conclusion of the investigation, the Accident/Incident/Near-Miss Report Form and Accident/Incident Investigation Form together with all supporting documentation are prepared and submitted to the appropriate Operations, Technical and the HSEQA Department. Root cause(s) identified, where possible, the recommendations for long term corrective / preventative action should be implemented within two weeks of the accident/incident/near-miss,

The report is one of the primary tools used to communicate the results of the investigation. It is the permanent record of what was done during the investigation, including the team's conclusions and recommendations.

Causal factors, root causes and recommendations should be presented in a manner that clearly shows the connection between each of these levels of the investigation. A standard method for presenting this relationship is a table with the causal factors in the first column, the root causes in the second column and the recommendations in the third column.

Fault trees or Why trees and causal factor charts should be included in the report or attached to the report. Fault trees or Whys trees and causal factor charts can often save the investigator additional writing by providing a summary of the including what happened, when it happened, who was involved and how it happened.

Photos shall be included in the simplest of reports. Photos of the scene and equipment can often be great time savers because photos save the writer from generating lengthy descriptions in the report.

6.7.10 Tracking recommendations - All recommendations must be resolved. Resolution does not necessarily require implementation, but it does require an evaluation and justification for the actions that are taken. Failure to document resolutions can increase legal and regulatory liability. In addition, failure to document a change to a resolution during implementation can also increase liability.

Tracking recommendations should continue until implementation of all of the recommendations is complete. The flowchart below, "Tracking Recommendations," illustrates a method for tracking recommendations (from incident investigations, hazard analyses, audits, etc.) to their final resolutions.

- 6.8 When an accident/near miss investigation has been carried out and the root cause(s) identified, the DPA will review and approve or amend the long term action as proposed by the vessel within two weeks.
- 6.9 All significant accident/near misses/non-conformance along with root cause and corrective action shall be circulated among fleet vessels to prevent occurrence on other vessels. The Company may also consider sharing the lessons learned with Industry Groups, Charterers, Classification Societies and Flag States etc. Similarly information gathered from external sources e.g. safety flashes from Classification Societies, Flag State, Industry bodies etc shall be circulated among fleet vessels to prevent occurrence.

# 7.0 MEDICAL REPORT - INJURY AND ILLNESS

7.1 For Medical Reporting of Injuries and Illnesses, see MLC Crewing Manual Appendix C.

Remember that the reporting of ill health can assist in:

- Checking the effectiveness of health control measures. a)
- ﻘ Identifying and protecting personnel from health risks.
- c) Raising awareness of illnesses and promoting preventive measures,

# 8. PROCEDURE FOR COMPANY INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENTS/INCIDENTS

- 8.1 If the DPA decides to initiate and lead further investigation of the accident of the severity of the accident or incident warrants it), the following procedure will be utilised:
- 8.2 Determining if an in-depth Investigation is needed:
- 8.2.1 Extract from:

IMO RESOLUTION A.884(21), adopted on 25 November 1999

AMENDMENTS TO THE CODE FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF MARINE CASUALTIES AND INCIDENTS (RESOLUTION A.849(20))

2.2 An occurrence may result in serious injury, illness, damage or environmental impact and sometimes all four.

The purpose of a marine casualty or occurrence safety investigation is to prevent recurrence of similar occurrences by identifying and recommending remedial action.

All minor occurrences of high potential in terms of credible result should be subjected to a full investigation.

# 8.2.2 Extract from the ISM Code:

As a minimum, the following information must be gathered:

- Who and what was involved? i.
- il. What happened, where and in what sequence?
- What were the actual or potential losses and their severity? ill.
- iv. What is the likelihood of a recurrence of the chain of events and/or conditions that led to the accident, incident or near-miss?

The answers to these questions will determine if an in-depth investigation is needed, or a cursory report will suffice. An in-depth investigation is required if there is a likelihood of recurrence which could have similar or more severe consequences.

- 8.3 Responsibility for carrying out further investigation of serious accidents.
- 8.3.1 HSEQA/DPA will be responsible for convening and leading the investigation.
- 8.3.2 As deemed necessary by HSEQA/DPA, the Operations, Technical, Crewing and Marketing Departments will provide appropriate personnel to participate in the investigation process.
- 8.3.3 The Operations, Technical, Crewing and Marketing Departments will also support HSEQA/DPA in finalising Investigation Reports, disseminating them accordingly (including to Client if required) and ensuring corrective / preventative action is implemented and effective.

# 8.4. Serious Incident Investigation Process.

Events/Condition

Incident occurs, Master reports to Company (DPA, Ops)

Initiate Investigation

In consultation with Ops Management, DPA decides whether to initiate investigation

# Form Investigating Team

If an investigation is necessary, DPA decides on composition of Investigating Team - HSEQA (leading), Ops, Tech, Crewing, Marketing, etc. supporting.

Investigating Team Meets

DPA sets up an initial meeting of investigating team

(ATTENDANCE AND FULL COMMITMENT IS COMPULSORY FOR ALL PERSONNEL NOMINATED TO INVESTIGATING TEAM)

# Investigation

HSEQA leads the Investigating Team.

Investigating Team analyses reports received (including Immediate Action already taken), decides on methodology of investigation and implements accordingly.

Team also decides on the necessity or otherwise to visit the vessel(s) concerned - if so, appropriate personnel are nominated and briefed accordinalv.

Initial Findings & Report

Investigating Team develops an Initial Investigation Report, including Immediate Causes, Root Causes (Management Failures) based on reports received, and Long Term Action to prevent recurrence.

If Client requires, this Initial Investigation Report can be presented to the Client (note : Report may be subject to further development, e.g. additional info, findings from vessel visit, etc.)

The personnel presenting the report to Client to include representation from HSEQA and any other Departments as may e necessary to show "Management Commitment" to the Client

# Final Report and Implementation

Investigating Team develops a Final Investigation Report (developed from the Initial Investigation Report) incorporating all the findings and actions taken / to be taken.

Investigating Team delegates actions to be taken to appropriate personnel

HSEQA Department and representatives from other Departments as necessary present Final Investigation Report to Client.

HSEQA Department follows up on actions to be taken until all are verified fully completed and the investigation is closed out

#### 10 INSURANCE & CLAIMS

- 10.1 This applies to incidents affecting or possibly affecting the Company's insurance and the reports that are required from the Master.
- 10.2 When incidents occur that are likely to lead to a claim under a particular policy, the Master of the vessel will make direct contact with the Company. The initial report maybe made by phone/email/fax. Prior to issuing any documentation (i.e. Letter of Indemnity, Notes of Protest, photographs, etc), the Master must request instruction from the Company with regard to procedure, documentation, document distribution and retention etc.
- 10.3 Normally, a full Company report is required from the Master and other ship's staff (if appropriate) backed up by relevant information and documentation.
- 10.4 The Master must ensure that he co-operates fully with Head Office personnel and their appointed representatives such as Insurance Surveyors. Prior to co-operation with non-Company representatives, it may be necessary to gain authorisation from the Company.
- 10.5 The Master must ensure that Officers keep detailed notes and times in order that reports can be as accurate as possible.

#### 11 LEGAL DOCUMENTS

- 11.1 General
- 11.2 In general, there are two types of Protest and these should not be confused :
- 11.3 Note of Protest. This is a declaration made by the Master and notarised by a Notary Public wherein the Master declares that circumstances beyond his control (e.g. heavy weather, declaration of general average) have caused loss or damage to cargo or ship. This protest may be extended for up to 6 months after the initial deposition. The original note should include the words "reserving the right to extend the protest at a time and place of convenient". When making a protest, all relevant documents or log extracts, together with witness statements must be presented to the person authorised to take the deposition. The protest should be made within 24 hours of arrival port.
- 11.4 Letter of Protest. A Letter of Protest is a formal letter regarding any matter over which the Master feels there might be a legal dispute or claim, holding the recipient responsible for any consequences of the matter being complained about. The letter can be about many things such as cargo, port, berth and the Master of the other vessels. Should such a letter be received from any source holding a Company vessel liable for any incident, the letter should be signed "for receipt only".

#### 12 DOCUMENT CONTROI

- 12.1 All accident/incident/near miss reports, investigation reports and legal documents must be forwarded to the management, which upon consulting with Legal Department (if necessary), will release them to the external parties. This is to protect the interest of the company, ship and the individual.
- 12.2 At no time should the vessel send these reports directly to external parties, unless specifically instructed to do so by the Company Management.

# 13 NON-CONFORMANCE REPORTING AND INVESTIGATION

- 13.1 A non-conformance is where a procedure has not been followed, and it therefore is necessary to find out why.
- 13.2 NC's are usually identified during audits and/or inspections, either by Company personnel, Classification Society auditors, Flag or Port State Inspectors or Charterer's personnel. However, anyone in the Company can raise an NC and report it to the HSEQA Department if it is observed that a procedure is not being followed as it should be.
- 13.3 Note that accidents, incidents and near-misses are not in themselves non-conformances. However, once they have been investigated and it is found that they resulted from a failure to follow a procedure then an NC should be raised accordingly.
- 13.4 Repairs, breakdowns and defects are also not non-conformances unless they directly affect safety and a weakness is identified in the Company's IMS System.
- 13.5 Resources
- 13.5.1 The Company recognises the need to provide the resources to ensure that a non-conformance of any nature is identified and corrective/preventative action taken by:
  - Recording, analysing and making decisions on situations that have resulted in identifying a) a non-conformances.
  - Providing resources to enable corrective/preventative action to be taken when nonb) conformances have been identified.
  - c) Maintaining effective communications to ensure all involved personnel are kept informed.
  - d) Review and update Company IMS where necessary.
- 13.6 Reporting Non-Conformances (NCR's)
- 13.6.1 All seagoing and shore-based staff are encouraged to report non-conformances, either in writing or verbally, to :
  - Their respective Heads of Departments a)
  - b) The Master of the vessel
  - DPA C)
  - d) HSEQA Department
- 13.6.2 The NCR is passed to the responsible manager who will liaise with the HSEQA Department.
- 13.6.3 All non-conformances will be recorded as follows :
  - a) Shibboard non-conformances will be noted by the Master of the vessel and recorded on a Non-Conformance Report.
  - Shore based non-conformances will be brought to the attention of the responsible Heads of Departments and also recorded on a NCR.
  - c) brought to the attention of the Master or Heads of Departments.

#### 4. Planning

#### 4.1 Environmental Aspects

PFS has reviewed all of its vessel and office-based activities that it can control and influence, including planned and new developments, activities and has identified all of its environmental aspects. These are listed in Appendix A, Register of Environmental Aspects, Identification and Evaluation.

Each identified environmental aspect is subject to analysis based on the consequences of environmental impact or impact on the organisation from environment-related issues, in the context of existing measures to control the risk. Both positive impacts can be considered. The impact analysis matrix is as follows:

| Significance<br>Evaluation | Consequence Evaluation |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

# 4.2 Legal and Other Requirements

The organisation is subject to legal and possibly non-legal requirements regarding the environmental aspects of its operations, and these are taken into account in establishing, implementing and maintaining the Company environmental management system.

Environmental aspects associated with a legal requirement, or another requirement to which the Company subscribes, such as Government policy, are also considered to be significant, regardless of the outcome of the impact analysis.

The Register of Legal and other requirements is listed in IMS 01 and details the statutory IMO and Flag State requirements applicable to the Company and its Fleet, as well as showing how the IMS addresses such requirements. It is maintained by the Company HSEQA Department who are also responsible for reporting on changing legal and other requirements as part of management reviews.

As the Company Fleet operates globally, it may, from time to time, be necessary for Company vessels to comply with local legislation and/or other local requirements. In such cases, the Company must do the following:

- · Ascertain what local legislation and/or other requirements may be applicable,
- · Evaluate the implications of compliance.
- · Develop a Register of applicable local legislation and/or other requirements.
- · Develop and implement whatever procedures and measures may be necessary to ensure compliance.
- · Ensure all appropriate personnel are briefed / trained accordingly,
- · Monitor compliance and report accordingly.

The Company marketing, operational and HSEQA management must work together to ensure the above requirements are met.

# 4.3 Objectives, Targets and Programme(s)

Consistent with the Company environmental policy, measurable objectives and targets are set each year regarding significant environmental aspects and recorded in Appendix D, Register of Environmental Objectives & Targets. The register also lists action plans, improvement programmes and controls for achieving those objectives and targets, as well as key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor progress in achieving the objectives and targets. The register is revised each year in the management review regarding the extent to which objectives and targets have been met.

#### 5 Implementation and Operation

# 5.1 Resources, Roles, Responsibility and Authority

Various positions in the organisation have roles, responsibilities and authorities for managing environmental aspects, action plans, programs and controls. The roles, responsibility and authority of staff with respect to the environmental management system is defined in IMS 02.

The Company HSEQA Department has responsibility for overall co-ordination of the environmental management system including monitoring of performance and recommendations for improvement to top management for review. The specific tasks associated with this role include:

- Maintenance of the Register of Environmental Aspects (Appendix A)

![](_page_264_Picture_0.jpeg)

# 4.2. ISM Certificates issued to the Ship

- 4.2.1 Safety Management Certificate (SMC) is issued by the Flag Administration (usually by the Classification Society on behalf of the Flag Administration) to the ship following an Interim, Initial, or Renewal audit onboard certifying compliance with the requirements of the ISM Code.
- 4.2.2 On successful completion of an Intermediate Verification Audit (carried out between the second and third anniversary of the Initial or Renewal Auditor will endorse the Intermediate Verification Section of the SMC (usually on the second page of the SMC) certifying compliance with the requirements of the ISM Code.
- 4.2.3.

- 4.2.4. Ship Security Plan Approval Certificate endorsing the approved Ship Security Plan (SSP) issued by Administration as recommended by a Recognised Security Organisation (RSO) usually Classification Society.
- 4.2.5. Continuous Synopsis Record (CSR) Issued by the Administration as part of the ISPS documentation to each ship providing an onboard record of the history of the ship. Any changes relating to the entries on the certificate will be carried out the Head Office, approved by the Flag State and issued to the vesse. As such there maybe more than 1 version of the CSR onboard (for example CSR No. 1, CSR No. 2 etc) and ALL previous CSRs must be kept onboard and be available for inspection at any time.

#### 5. DEFINITIONS

# 5.1. HSEQ Integrated Management System (IMS)

5.1.1. A structured and documented system enabling Company personnel to implement effectively the Company policies.

#### 5.2. Major Non-Conformity

- 5.2.1. An identifiable failure to follow procedures or observe regulations which poses a serious threat to personnel or ship safety or a serious risk to the environment and requires immediate corrective action. In addition, the lack of effective and systematic implementation of a requirement of a code or standard is also considered a major non-conformity.
- 5.2.2. The issuing of an ISM related major non-conformity during a vessel audit will result in the suspension or withdrawal of the vessel's SMC, thereby preventing the vessel obtaining clearance to enter or leave port.
- 5.2.3. The issuing of a major ISM related non-conformity during an office audit will result in the suspension or withdrawal of the office DoC for that Flag State, thereby preventing any of the Company's vessels registered under that Flag State from obtaining clearance to enter or leave port.

#### 5.3. Non-Conformity (NC)

5.3.1 An observed situation where objective evidence indicates the non-fulfilment of a specific requirement. Namely, when objective evidence, which substantiates the non-fulfilment of a

| Issue Status  | 2nd Edition, Rev 0 |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Issue Date    | 1st July 2014      |
| Issued by     | DPA                |
| Authorised By | Director PFS       |

specific requirement of the Company's IMS, the ISM Code, or Rules and Regulations, is found, the matter shall be judged as Non-conformity.

- 5.3.2. Note that a previously raised NC that has not been corrected at the time of the next audit may be upgraded to a Major Non-Conformity.
- 5.3.3 All personnel are responsible for identifying and reporting non-conformances, and the Master is responsible for reporting all non-conformances to the DPA and HSEQA Dept. He shall also take whatever immediate corrective/preventative action as may be necessary onboard the vessel.

#### 5.4. Observation

- 5.4.1 A statement of fact made during the auditor considers ought to be recorded, although it does not necessarily constitute any non-fulfilment of the requirements of the Code or Company IMS.
- 5.4.2. In effect, an Observation indicates that although the requirements of the Code or Company System are being complied with, the way compliance is being implemented can be improved upon.
- 5.4.3. Nevertheless, if the same observation is made at a subsequent audit, it may be upgraded to an NC.

# 5.5 NC Investigation and Root Cause Analysi

5.5.1 All NC's raised should be investigated in order to identify the root cause and implement effective corrective / preventative action. The investigation will not only help to determine what and how an event occurred but also why it happened, thereby ensuring workable corrective and preventive astion to prevent future recurrence can be specified and implemented.

#### 5.6 Corrective Action (CA)

5.6.1 An action taken to eliminate the cause of a detected non-conformity or other undesirable situation. CA addresses actual problems. Because of this, the corrective action process can be thought of as a problem solving process, ie an instrument that has not been calibrated needs to be calibrated, or a member of the staff's training record that is not up to date should be updated, etc. (See Preventive Action below).

#### 5.7 Preventive Action

- 5.7.1 An action taken to eliminate the cause of a potential non-conformity or other potentially undesirable situation. This is especially important when a lesson is learned from other's nonconformity, ie incident, injury, port state deficiency, etc. Hence, the preventive action process here is to prevent the occurrence of non-conformities or situations that do not yet exist. It tries to prevent occurrence by eliminating causes.
- 5.7.2 A further action which is established to eliminate the recurrence of one's own non-conformity, after completing the CA. Note: PA must be effectively established in order to prevent recurrence as, prevention is better than cure.

#### AUDIT PLANNING AND SCHEDULING 6.

6.1 The HSEQA Department prepares and continuously updates the office and fleet audit plan, taking into consideration the required audit frequency. The audit plan addresses internal and

#### 1. PURPOSE

- 1.1. A Planned Maintenance System (PMS) ensures that maintenance, repair and dry-docking work is carried out in an efficient, controlled and effective manner, with adequate records , maintained
- The Chief Engineer is required to manage the PMS onboard with the assistance of the Chief 1.2. Officer. However, the ultimate responsibility rests with the Master.
- 1.3. WinSDS (Windows Ship Data System) is implemented onboard the vessels for the management of Planned Maintenance and Spare Parts onboard the vessels. Data is daily exchanged between the Head Office and the ship. The Superintendents and the Purchasing Officers use Head Office version of WinSDS. They are therefore able to oversee the Planned Maintenance onboard and follow up on the spare parts requisitions.

#### つ PLANNED MAINTENANCE

- 2.1 A planned approach to repair and maintenance is most important. Without careful planning, there can be no identification of workload, which could lead to improper work allocation, inefficient personnel utilisation and possible oversights.
- 2.2. When it is envisaged that some stores, spares or material will be required to effectively undertake some foreseeable routine maintenance and repair items, the necessary requisition should be created in WinSDS under Spares and Stores Windows well before hand for ensuring timely supply so as not to hamper the schedule.
- 2.3. Inventory of spares and stores should be updated whenever items are received or consumed to keep the inventory accordingly
- 2.4. Before undertaking routine maintenance or repairs of any component which can be best done while in port, the duration of the vessel's port stay should be known and a judgement made whether the job can be affected in the time-frame, in order not to cause any delay of the vessel
- 2.5. Repair work which the capabilities of the ship's staff or which involves fabrication or expert knowledge etc. should be planned as far as possible to be attended to during the vessel's routine dry-docking or periods of long port stay without compromising the safe operation of the vessel.

#### 3 CONDITION BASED MAINTENANCE

- 3.1 -An additional maintenance system when applied to planned maintenance for the purpose of initiating maintenance procedures is intimately linked to "performance monitoring" or referred to as "predictive maintenance"
- 3.2 Condition based maintenance means any measurable condition (Data on wear and tear, Electrical, Evaluation criterion, Load, Performance check, Pressure, Temperature, Visual, Vibration, Water-tightness factor) supported by what may be used as part of a maintenance routine and that the condition being monitored is convenient to read with repeatable results being achieved.
- 3.3 This kind of maintenance system is applied to monitoring the condition in real time that is when the machinery is in operation or running. A condition based maintenance record can be used to show the current status of the running machinery in good order and that does not require the components of the machinery from being dismantled for the inspection or survey.
- 3.4 This approach of maintenance can have considerable savings in terms of spares and down time as well as in terms of human resource necessary to carry out the overhaul and reassembly of the machinery

#### A LSA & FFE MAINTENANCE

#### 4.1 Responsibility

- 4.1.1 The Master designates the Chief Officer to be in overall charge of ensuring the maintenance work is carried out. However, the Chief Officer may designate one of the Deck Officers and the Chief Engineer may designate one of the Engineers to actually carry out the maintenance work.
- 4.1.1 The designated Officer onboard shall maintain a record of safety/emergency equipment maintenance (either in the PMS or in hard copy) as required by SOLAS which should be kept updated for inspection.
- 4.1.2 All equipment is checked and maintained as required by Class/Flag/IMO.
- 4.1.3 To assist in carrying out the LSA maintenance, the SOLAS Checklist for Life Saving Appliances (SOLAS Chapter III Regulation 20/36) may be used as a guideline.

- 4.2.2 As far as reasonable and practicable, the rescue boat/FRC shall be launched each month with their assigned crew aboard and manoeuvred in the water. In all cases this requirement shall be complied with at least every three months. (Note : if in port, it is usually necessary to obtain permission from Authorities to do so). When fully lowered, the boat should be let go from the falls and the crew given the opportunity of maneuvering the rescue boat. At the same time the Rescue Boat launching system must be tested. This procedure should be supervised by an Officer and good communications should be maintained with the vessel. On completion, a record of these tests should be made in the log book.

New lifting appliances shall not be brought into use unless accompanied by the manufacturers test certificate. A copy of all test certificates shall be retained with the "Lifting Gear Register" and will be inspected during internal audit and or 3<sup>rd</sup> party inspection.

#### 12.2 Lifting Gear Register.

A "Lifting Gear Register Deck" and "Lifting Gear Register Engine Room" must be maintained for deck and engine room equipment which shall contain the data of all lifting gear and loose items provided on board

Maintenance of the Deck lifting gear shall be under the Chief Officer and Engine Lifting gear under the Chief Engineer.

{341}------------------------------------------------

The information shall include:

- The item number and safe working load. a.
- The certificate number. b.
- C. Total quantity on board.
- ರ Frequency of inspection.
- e. Type of inspection.
- f. Date of last inspection.
- Re- certification. g.
- h. Repairs carried out if any.
- i. Any other relevant information.

#### 12.3 Inspection.

In addition to the pre and post operation inspection, the following inspection regime shall be followed:

- 3 monthly general inspections internal. a.
- b. 6-monthly thorough inspection of lifting gear and change of colour coding - internal.
- 12 monthly thorough examination / operational test internal. C.
- Test and examination following substantial alteration or repair external. ত
- e. 5 yearly testing of lifting gear and renewal of certification - external.
- Statutory inspection as required by class / flag (annual/periodical / dry docking). f.
- Load test and inspection of cranes shall be carried out every intermediate and 5 yearly g. docking.

Equipment must be inspected for any obvious signs of deterioration before each use. If at any time there is a reason to doubt the safety condition of the equipment, it must be withdrawn from service and subjected to a thorough examination. If the tag or label identifying the gear and its working load limit becomes detached and necessary information is not marked, it must be withdrawn from service.

#### 12.4 Colour Coding.

All loose lifting gear to be colour coded after inspection on six monthly basis, with changeover periods for inspection / re-colour coding being from 15<sup>th</sup> June to 15<sup>th</sup> July and 15<sup>th</sup> December to 15<sup>th</sup> January.

| January to June   | 15th June to 15th July,<br>colour changeover<br>period   | July to December   | 15th December to<br>15th January,<br>colour changeover<br>period   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |

When a vessel is required to implement the charterer's colour regime and inspection schedule, they may do so after consultation from operation department.

# 12.5 Quarantine and Disposal of Defective Lifting Gear.

Any defective lifting equipment shall be immediately removed from service, marked in red colour and stored in a safe place, covered box, to prevent accidental use. The box for quarantine of damage equipments shall be marked as "Damaged Gear- Do Not Use".

The disposal of damaged gear is to be carried out as per the Garbage Management Plan after approval from operation and technical departments.

# 12.6 General Maintenance and Inspection.

Inspection and maintenance guidelines and frequency for cranes are provided in the PMS / WinSDS. The guidance for maintenance and inspection codes for loose lifting gear is provided in an excel sheet together with inventory of equipment.

Lifting gear shall not be left lying around where it can be damaged or degraded due to weather.

During the inspection and maintenance, the following guidelines shall be taken into account :

- a. Greasing should be thorough and frequent, as dry bearings impose additional loads that can lead to failure.
- ﻣ The condition of all slings and chains should be checked for wear, damage and corrosion and replaced as necessary.
- Shackles, links and rings should be renewed when wear or damage is evident.
- d. Structures should be examined for corrosion, cracks, distortion and wear of bearings, securing points, etc.
- Hollow structures, if so designed, should be checked for trapped water inside. If water is e. e. . found, the structure should be drained, appropriately treated and then sealed.
- f. There should be function tests of controls, stops, brakes, safety devices for hoisting gear etc, preferably before the start of operations.

#### 12.7 TRAINING

Only those trained and competent to do so should operate any lifting appliance and personnel assisting in lifting operations must also be trained and competent.

Such training may be "in-house", including "on the job training" by another worker or a supervisor, or may be training provided by the equipment manufacturer or another outside body.

The designated crane operator may be issued with a crane operator certificate by the Master after he has undergone briefing and thorough training by Chief Engineer and Electrical Engineer for cranes of less than 10T SWL.

Instruction should be given to the vessel's personnel to enable them to appreciate factors affecting the safe operation of lifting appliances.

#### 13 Maintenance and Care of Mooring Ropes

- 13.1 In order to ensure that ropes remain in satisfactory condition and free of damage, the following points should be borne in mind by crew involved in mooring activities:
  - Ropes should not be left exposed to sunlight whilst at sea; they should either be covered to a. or stored below deck.
  - Ropes need to be kept clear of the deck to ensure they do not come into contact with any ڪ chemicals which may be detrimental to their strength.
  - C. Ropes should be stored clear of sources of heat.
  - It should be ensured that all mooring rollers are free turning and are free from damage on ರ. rust on their surfaces which could cause rope wear.
  - Winch drum ends, bollards and Panama leads need to be free of damage or rust which e. could cause rope wear.
  - Ropes should not be surged on winch drum ends or slacked away by rendering; ropes f. should be walked back so far as possible.
  - g. Sharp angles in the lead of the rope are to be avoided and it must be remembered that these may exist when the mooring rope runs along the hull between the fairlead and the mooring bollard on the wharf.

- h. Ropes should not be led such that they cross other ropes, be they either fibre or wire, which could lead to wear during the port stay.
- ﮯ۔ Avoid overloading over the above maximum working load
- Inspect full length regularly and operating length before and after each use j.
- Keep rope clean-imbedded dirt is abrasive on fibres ("sandpaper" effect) and will speed k. up the wear, wash ropes with fresh water periodically if it has been in contact with sea water.
- Distribute the wear reverse occasionally from time to time so that the outer spliced part comes in and vice versa
- If a rope part gets damaged, cut out this section and splice the rest good (uninjured) part m.
- Avoid kinks sharp angles, shock and dynamic loads and the combination of friction and n. high loads, avoid unnecessary wear - winch drums, pulley sheaves etc. Should be smooth; don't drag rope over rough surfaces, Do not bend over angled parts, corners and sharp edges or use over rough surfaces without sheaves or chafe protection
- Know the working limit (WLL) of your rope, the maximum working load of the rope is o voided if shock and dynamic loads are applied on the rope
- p. reduce ropes' strength by up to 50%. Make a splice instead of a knot
- Do not stand within recoil (snapback zone) area should rope or attachment break death σ or limb damage can occur

#### 13.2 Damage to Ropes

Below are some examples for which the condition of the rope will have to be re-evaluated before using it again.

The part that shows the large localised wear (internally or externally) must be cut out and the rope re-spliced, or the rope must be withdrawn from further use and be destroyed / recycled according to the local legislation or other regulations on handling end of life products.

#### 13.3 Mooring Rope Inspection

Apart from a visual inspection by ship staff prior to berthing and periodic inspections by the watch keeper whilst alongside, mooring ropes should be periodically inspected along their entire length at least once a month.

The wear along the rope should be externally examined and areas of wear and fusing on manmade fibre ropes closely checked to assess the integrity of the rope at these points.

{344}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_344_Picture_0.jpeg)

Areas of degradation should also be inspected closely to assess the rope's integrity.

Eye splice integrity and eye wear needs to be checked and the strands of the rope opened up to check for internal wear, the pilling of the internal surfaces on a man-made fibre rope is an indication of hard use.

Mooring ropes, both loose coils used on the bitts and those on winch drums should be end for ended once the working end becomes worn.

# It is recommended that major damage should not be cropped out and replaced with a short splice as this will reduce the strength of the rope.

If there is any doubt as to the strength or integrity of a rope then it should be replaced.

#### 1. GENERAL

- 1.1. An effective bridge organisation efficiently manages all the bridge resources and promotes good communication and teamwork. The need to maintain a proper look-out determines the basic composition of a navigational watch. Effective bridge management utilises all resources, human and technical, available to the bridge team to ensure the safe navigation of the vessel at all times.
- 1.2. The Operations Manager is responsible for setting navigation standards and limitations (including DP operation standards and limitations) on board Company vessels. Masters are reminded of the Company "STOP WORK POLICY" if it is likely that the Company limitations may be exceeded or if he feels the safety of the vessel may be at risk.
- 1.3. The Master has the ultimate responsibility for the safety of the ship. Delegation of authority to the Officer of the Watch (OOW) should be undertaken in accordance with agreed procedures and reflects the ability and experience of the watch-keeper.
- 1.4. The Officer on Watch is responsible for the safe navigation of the vessel while on watch and for giving the Master full assistance while the Master has the 'con'.
- 1.5. The Master and Officers have at their disposal many navigational aids to assist the safe passage of the vessel. However these 'aids' will not be effective, in fact may even prove to be a danger, if they are not used correctly and with due regard to their limitations.
- 1.6. The Master and Officers should never forget the basics of navigation and should always base critical decisions on sound information and with due regard to good seamanship. The Master and Officers should never become over-reliant on navigational aids and should bear in mind the most effective tool for safe navigation is still visual observation.
- 1.7. The 'International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea' (ColRegs) should always be complied with.
- 1.8. The Master should write clear and precise 'Standing Orders' which should be available to the Officers on Watch. The Master and all watchkeeping officers should sign and date such orders.
- 1.9. The Master shall maintain a 'Night Order Book'. This is to be completed every night, whether at sea, at anchor or alongside, and must contain instructions for the officer of the Watch. The Night Orders must be signed by the Master and counter-signed by the Officers of the Watch on taking over the watch.
- 1.10. All personnel should be well rested and in a fit state to stand a watch. A watch should not be handed over if incoming personnel are not considered fit to take over. For guidance on work hours and fitness for duty, refer to STCW and MLC.

Note that a Waypoint Checklist should form part of a passage plan, but should not in itself be considered as a complete Passage Plan.
- 2.1.2 The Passage Plan and Waypoint checklist shall be from berth, the only exceptions being when the voyage is to and from an offshore location and when the passage requires the vessel to operate within the 500m zone.
- 2.1.3 Offshore installations must never be used as waypoints when preparing a passage plan & waypoint checklist. The intermediate or last waypoint in all cases should be at least 1 mile away from any offshore installation. The courses should be laid in such a manner that they do not directly head towards the offshore installation.
- 2.1.4 The Master shall give final approval to all Passage Plans before they are executed. The Master, the Navigating Officer, the Chief Officer and the Chief Engineer must countersign the Passage Plan.
- 2.1.5 Planning a vessel's passage will involve the Master, Chief Officer, 200 Officer (Navigating Officer) and the Chief Engineer. So
- 2.1.6 All Bridge Watchkeeping Officers (OOW) shall review and verify the passage plan and waypoint checklist, including courses laid and charts in use/to be used, prior to taking over their watch.
- 2.1.7 The Master shall be informed immediately if the OOW encounters:
  - The course line is found to stop short on a particular chart for no apparent reason, a.
  - The course line is not continued on the next chart. b.
  - Course line passes close to or over a potential danger. C.

The Master, upon being informed of the above by the OOW, shall immediately review the course and that particular part of the passage, including amending the passage plan and waypoint checklist accordingly and recording the changes made.

- 2.1.8 If any deviation from the planned route is required, the Master shall inform all bridge team members and a new/updated passage plan must be prepared. The Master, Bridge Watchkeeping Officers and the Chief Engineer must initial the new/updated passage plan.
- 2.1.9 For any deviation in the vessel passage plan, the Master may use the Management of Change process as detailed out in IMS03 to document that the changes have been properly considered. Such a Management of Change Plan is to be attached to the amended copy of the Passage Plan.
- 2.1.10 The vessel's progress as per the passage plan must be monitored throughout the passage.

{355}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_355_Picture_0.jpeg)

- 2.1.11 The position of the vessel must be closely checked and plotted when approaching course alteration points / wheel over positions, to ensure that the vessel is safely on the new course line after the alteration of course.
- 2.1.12 Distinctive chart features should be used for monitoring the ships position visually, by radar and by echo sounder.
- 2.1.13 The Passage Plan format is included in Appendix A of this Procedure and is for the use of Masters and Second Officers when preparing their Passage Plans.

- d Each voyage or passage plan as well as the details of the plan, should be approved by the ships' master prior to the commencement of the voyage or passage.

#### 2.2.3 Execution

- a. Having finalized the voyage or passage plan, as soon as time of departure and estimated time of arrival can be determined with reasonable accuracy, the voyage or passage should be executed in accordance with the plan or any changes made thereto.
- b. Factors which should be taken into account when executing the plan, or deciding on any departure there from include:
  - i) The reliability and condition of the vessel's navigational equipment;
  - Estimated times of arrival at critical points for tide heights and flow; ii)

- e. Traffic conditions, especially at navigational focal points.

{358}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_358_Picture_0.jpeg)

f. It is important for the master to consider whether any particular circumstance, such as the forecast of restricted visibility in an area where position fixing by visual means at a critical point is an essential feature of the voyage or passage plan, introduces an unacceptable hazard to the safe conduct of the passage; and thus whether that section of the passage should be attempted under the conditions prevailing or likely to prevail. The master should also consider at which specific points of the voyage or passage there may be a need to utilize additional deck or engine room personnel.

#### 2.2.4 Monitoring

- a. The plan should be available at all times on the bridge to allow officers of the navigational watch immediate access and reference to the details of the plan.
- b. The progress of the vessel in accordance with the voyage and passage plan should be closely and continuously monitored. Any changes made to the plan should be made consistent with these Guidelines and clearly marked and recorded.
- 225 Under Keel Clearance

The following are the minimum under-keel clearance (UKC) prescribed for each situation namely:

| a.  | Ocean passages | -   | 20% of the deepest draft      |
| --- | -------------- | --- | ----------------------------- |
| b.  | Fairways       | -   | 15% of the deepest draft      |
| c.  | Inside ports   | -   | 10% of the deepest draft      |
| d.  | Canals         | -   | as per local navigation rules |

Allowances for variable factors and local conditions should include, but not be limited to, the following:

- 2.2.13 Masters should also take in to account of vessel's skeg as it will result in increase of aft draft to a great extent, the declared aft draft should include the value of the skeg in all cases.
- 2.2.14 Squat

{360}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_360_Picture_0.jpeg)

The squat effect is the hydrodynamic phenomenon by which a vessel moving quickly through shallow water creates an area of lowered pressure that causes the ship to be closer to the seabed than would otherwise be expected. This phenomenon is caused when water that should normally flow under the hull encounters resistance due to the close proximity of the hull to the seabed. This causes the water to move faster, creating a low-pressure area with lowered water level surface. This squat effect results from a combination of vertical sinkage and a change of trim that may cause the vessel to dip towards the stern or towards the bow. Squat may be computed using the empirical formula given below (Dr C. B. Barras's formula):

Calculate the vessel's maximum draft with additional factors to be taken into account i.e. trim, list, vessel's manoeuvring characteristics, hog, sag and water density(While calculating trim, the change in trim due to the change in density of water must also be accounted for).

# Maximum Squat = $(Cb x V^2)$ / 100 for open waters

# Maximum Squat = $(Cb \times V^2)$ / 50 for confined channels

| Sq  | :   | Squat in metres                                    |
| --- | --- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Cb  | :   | Block coefficient of vessel at max navigable draft |
| V   | :   | Speed in knots.                                    |

Worked example:

(For vessel having Cb: 0.5, speed: 10 knots in confined water)

Squat = $(0.5 \times 10^2)$ / 50 = 1.0 m

Squat effect is approximately proportional to the square of the ship. Thus, by reducing speed by half, the squat effect is reduced by a factor of four. Squat effect is usually felt more when the depth/draft ratio is less than four or when sailing close to a bank. It can lead to unexpected groundings and handling difficulties. Another important factor is the block coefficient Cb as Squat varies directly with Cb. Oil Tankers will therefore have comparatively more squat than Passenger Liners.

- 2.2.15 The overall effect of shallow water on the maneuvering characteristics of a vessel;
  - a. Speed of the vessel decreases as squat is directly proportional to square of speed.
  - R.P.M. decreases and high R.P.M. increases astern trim. ﻘ
  - C. Higher the draught to depth of water ratio, greater the squat thus resulting in lesser U.K.C
  - d. Vibration may occur.
  - e. In shallow water squal causes abnormal bow and stem wave to build up there by the type of bow effects wave making and pressure distribution.
  - Steering is affected because the water displaced by the hull is not so easily replaced f. by other water and the propeller and rudder might be working in partially vacuum conditions. The vessel takes long to answer her helm and response to engine movement become sluggish.
  - It will be extremely difficult to correct a yaw or sheer with any degree of rapidity. g.
    တ
  - h. The moving vessels bow wave, stem wave and trough increase in amplitude.
  - i-Signs of Squat:
    - Speed decreases.
    - RPM decreases. .
    - Vibration may occur. .
    - · Steering is affected vessel become sluggish to maneuver.

![](_page_364_Picture_0.jpeg)

action(s) that is in contravention to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea

- ف All vessels should be given a wide berth whenever possible.
- C. The use of the VHF during potential 'close quarter' situations should, as far as possible, be avoided as it is not always possible to confirm that the vessel being spoken to on the VHF is the same vessel that is involved in the close quarter situation.
- Do not rely on navigational aids for the purpose of collision avoidance, unless poor ರ. visibility prevents visual observations.
- Whenever possible, visual observation should be used, supported by the use of e. e navigational aids.

The Bridge watch consists of one Deck watch officer on the bridge at all times, with the lookout / helmsman readily available within communicating distance. Bridge watch I is applicable in daytime only from sunrise to sunset.

Bridge watch I condition shall only be followed after the situation has been carefully assessed on each occasion and it has been established without doubt that it is safe to do so. Full account shall be taken of all prevalent factors including but not limited to the state of weather, current, condition of visibility, traffic density and proximity to navigational hazards and if navigating in or near a traffic separation scheme.

When the OOW is acting as a sole lookout, he must not hesitate to summon assistance to the bridge. Chart corrections, paperwork, port formalities or any such job shall not be undertaken by the OOW during such times.

The Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System (BNWAS) (if fitted) is to be kept operational whenever the OOW is acting as a sole lookout.

# 3.13.4 Bridge Watch II

The Bridge watch consists of one deck watch officer and lookout / helmsman on the bridge at all times.

- 3.13.7 In addition to above bridge watch keeping procedures, whenever vessel is engaged in Anchor handling operation or working within 500 metre zone of any installation, platform or any other type of vessel, the bridge shall be manned with at least 2 watch keepers, one being the master or equivalent competent officer.
- 3.13.8 The status of every watch shall be logged into the Deck including the timing when bridge watch level was increased or downgraded.

#### 3.14 Safe Waiting Place

While vessel is idle or is put on waiting due to any reason, following factors, but not limited to, should be taken into consideration while selecting for a safe waiting place:

- Condition of engines/thruster, breakdown/failures/maintenance a.
- Depth of water, nature of seabed, underwater obstruction ﻘ
- Prevailing and expected current & tidal condition C.
- Type of cargo onboard, hazardous cargo will require special designated place ﺗ

{367}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_367_Picture_0.jpeg)

- Prevailing and expected weather in the area, Monsoon/TRS e.
- f. Fishing traffic, chances of net fouling with propellers/thruster
- Traffic in vicinity, clear of traffic routes/lanes g.
- h. Piracy/Terrorism in the area
- Anchored vessels in vicinity, safe room i.
- j. Proximity to port for logistic support
- k. Length of stay
- 1. Navigational warnings, T & P corrections
- Local rules and regulations m.

Master is required to inform HSE, operations and charterer, if any, of his intended safe waiting place before proceeding or anchoring.

#### 4 ANCHORING

- 4.1 Anchoring Plan The Master shall prepare a plan for anchoring in accordance with the following:
- 4.1.1 Selection of Anchorage Investigate the port conditions beforehand, and select the most suitable anchorage.
- 4.1.2 Determining of Anchoring Method Normal anchoring is by a single anchor. The master shall determine which anchoring is the best among a single anchoring, double anchoring, twoanchor mooring or any other appropriate anchoring by considering weather & sea conditions when anchoring the ship and also while the ship is at anchor, or the depth of, or room for the anchoring area for use, etc.
- 4.1.3 Deciding Which Anchor To Be Used Decide which anchor (port or starboard) to use by considering the anchoring method direction of approach, tidal current set, frequency of use of both anchors until now, or measures against expected rough weather, etc. Also, when using the anchors on both sides of the ship, decide on the sequence in which they will be dropped.
- 4.1.4 Deciding on Extension of Anchor Chains When deciding on the length of anchor chains to be extended, give consideration to the duration of anchoring, room of the anchoring area for use, weather conditions while the ship is at anchor and holding power of the anchor.

Empirical or Rule of Thumb Methods for Assessing the Minimum Required Length of Anchor Chain :

Fine weather L = 3d + 60m Rough weather : L = 4d + 100m L: Minimum Required Length of Anchor Chain (m) Where: d: Water depth (m)

# 4.1.5 Holding power of the anchor and Critical Wind Velocity for dragging anchor

To avoid any disasters resulting from dragging anchor, Master shall calculate the holding power of the anchor and critical wind velocity for dragging anchor. This should be utilised in developing the anchoring plan and the anchor watch instructions / checks. It should also be noted that this calculation only provides a guide to understanding how the wind velocity affects anchor dragging and that the ship may start to drag its anchor even if the wind velocity is less than the critical wind velocity. It should be carefully examined to determine whether safe anchoring can be maintained especially when heavy weather is forecast.

- a. Note that the critical wind velocity is subject to preconditions such as the size or shape of the ship, depth of water, bottom sediment, etc.
- b. The following are to be considered when assessing the risk of dragging anchor:

{368}------------------------------------------------

| Issued by     | DPA                |
| Authorised By | Director PFS       |

- Even if the wind velocity is not more than the critical wind velocity, the ship may drag or damage her anchor due to other additional factors such as swells, waves, currents, age & condition of anchor itself, its chain, shackles etc.
- · It is very difficult to heave up anchor if the weather, especially the sea condition, becomes heavy or unfavourable.

#### 4.2 Preparing To Drop Anchor

Carry out RISK ASSESSMENT and TOOL BOX TALK.

Conduct the preparatory work for anchoring in accordance with the following:

- 4.2.1 The Master, at an appropriate time before arriving at the anchoring area for use, shall call anchor stations and advise the person-in- charge of the anchors to be used, the expected number of shackles to be laid out, the expected depth of anchoring area for use and other necessary information.
- 4.2.2 Conduct the following on the Bridge:
  - When the ship is approaching the anchorage, take continuous soundings to check the a. depth.
  - Check the head way of the ship (over ground and through the water), ﻔ
  - Check frequently the ship's position and distance from other ships. c. .
  - Keep a particularly close lookout of the surroundings to check the movements of d. other ships.
  - Plot, as occasion demands, the positions of other anchored ships on the nautical e. chart.
- 4.2.3 The person-in- charge of the anchor party, after taking up the station at the forecastle, checks that all hands are wearing the proper PPE including safety goggles. Make preparations to drop anchor in accordance with the following procedures:
  - Start up the windlass and test-run it to check for any abnormality; then take off the as a stopper.
  - Walk out the anchor chains until the anchor is just above the water, apply the brake, ﻣ put out of gear and stand by for dropping the anchor (alternatively, the anchor may be walked out to the expected full length).
  - c. When walking out the anchor chains under water, do it after the ship has lost all head way or, better still, when the ship is making slight stern way.
  - d. It is a good practice to also prepare the anchor that is not planned to be used, just in case of emergency.
  - e. When the above work is finished, report to the bridge that preparations to drop the anchor have been completed.

#### 4.3 Operations to Drop Anchor

- 4.3.1 The person-in-charge, on the Master's order to "let go anchor" shall let go anchor in accordance with the following procedures. When letting go anchor into deep water, he shall do it in accordance with Para.4.4:
  - a. On the order from the bridge to "let go anchor", do a final check on deck and on the water that it is safe to do so, then slowly release the brake until the anchor cable starts to run out.

- b. down or stop it again using the brake. Pay attention and carefully control the speed at which the anchor and cable runs out.
- Report to the bridge at appropriate times, advising the direction in which the anchor C. cable is lying, the length of cable paid out and the tension of the cable.
- When the planned length of anchor cable to be laid is reached, apply the brake to d. fully stop the cable.
- e.. Allow the ship time to settle at and become "brought up" to the anchor.
- f. After checking that the anchor has been brought up, put on the stopper, relieve the tension on the windlass, ensure the brake is fully applied and put the windlass out of gear.
- While using stopper bar upon vessel being brought-up, it is required that the in-board g. vertical link of the chain does not touch the bar and that there is sufficient clearance between the vertical link and the stopper to detect any slippage of the brake.
- 4.3.2 The OOW determines the anchor position and enters the "Bridge Turning Circle" on the nautical chart.

#### Anchoring in Deep Water র্বা বা

Lowering of the anchor in deep water shall be done in accordance with the following procedure:

- a. When the depth of the water exceeds 25 meters, walk back the anchor under water close to the sea bottom (10 to 5 meters) and then let it go.
- b. When the depth of the water exceeds 50 meters, walk back the anchor until it reaches the sea bottom and pay out the anchor chain under power to the scheduled amount of chain to be laid out while laying the anchor chain along the sea bottom.
- c. In the above case, when paying out the anchor chain, speed over the ground shall be 0.5 knots or less.

# 4.5 Points to be Observed when Anchoring

The Master, when anchoring at an anchorage with strong winds or currents, shall carry out risk assessment and shall be careful of the following:

- a Avoid anchoring for shorter periods unless as per Charterer's and/or Owner's requirements.
- b. Pay Due consideration to the condition of hydraulic gear, windlass motors, anchors, cable, and brake lining.
- c. The anchor chain is liable to be subjected to an unexpected load causing the anchor to drag in the initial stage of laying out the chain after the anchor is let go, or causing the chain to lie curved or snaked on the sea bottom so that a good hold of the anchor cannot be obtained.

{370}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_370_Picture_0.jpeg)

- If judging the speed over the ground is difficult, set a landmark that is exactly abeam ﯽ to the ship to obtain the speed over the ground.
- Make the approach and lower the anchor with the tide from the bow. (In case of e. single anchoring).
- Check the current set from the headings of other anchored ships nearby are facing. f.
- Pay out ample anchor chain so that the anchor does not drag initially, g.
- h. Try as much as possible not to have the current from behind, but if this is unavoidable, lessen the way of the ship and let go the anchor on the turning side of the ship at a short distance from the scheduled anchorage.
- . When there is a ship already anchored in the vicinity of scheduled anchorage, avoid the course on which the ship may drag her anchor.

# 4.6. Anchor Watch under Normal Weather Conditions

The Master shall give the necessary instructions for keeping an anchor watch to the officer of the watch (OOW).

The OOW shall pay careful attention to any changes of the weather and sea conditions and at all times be aware of the positions of others ships relative to his own ship, as well as the position of shoals, rocks and anything else that poses a danger to the ship.

He shall also check at least hourly to ensure the anchor is not dragging,

# 4.6.1 Detecting a dragging anchor :

a. Check of Ship's Position.

Determine the ship's position by means of radar, GPS or by landmark and judge whether or not the anchor is dragging by checking to see if the ship's position is inside the "Bridge Turning Circle".

# b. Record of Course Recorder.

The anchor might be dragging when the recorder stops drawing a steady sine curve,

c. Swinging of Ship.

The anchor might be dragging when the ship stops making steady swings and remains in one posture against the wind. The number of times when the vessel swings to complete 360° turns should be recorded.

d. Tautness of Anchor Chain.

The anchor might be dragging when the anchor chain does not slacken and remains taut. e. Speed over Ground

Check the speed over the ground by Doppler log.

f. Changes in Relative Positions of Other Ships

{371}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_371_Picture_0.jpeg)

Pay careful attention to any changes in the relative positions of other ships,

# 4.6.2 Dragging Anchor of Own or Other Ships

, Monitor for dragging not only the anchor of the ship but those of other ships as well,

When the cable is slipping or anchor is dragging, extra length of cable may be paid out. At initial anchoring, it is recommended to keep lengths of reserve cable, which may be used later.

Remember that even if your own ship is not dragging its anchor, other ships may be and therefore it is important to plot and monitor the positions of other anchored vessels.

#### 4.6.3 Watching Other Ships

When other ships pass by, the Master/OOW shall pay careful attention to ensure they do not pass too close.

If the other vessel is considered to be passing too close, the Master/OOW must attract the attention and communicate with the other vessel in order to prevent collision.

When other ships drop their anchor and the Master considers it dangerous as the other ship's anchoring position is too close to his own ship, he shall immediately request the other ship to heave up their anchor and change their anchoring position.

# 4.7 Anchor Watch under Rough Weather Conditions

The Master shall take the following necessary countermeasures when rough weather is expected while anchored:

- a. Obtain weather information from weather maps, navigational warnings, etc. Check with the agent or the nearest maritime safety authorities whether or not there have been any gale warnings, etc.
- b.. Keep a listening watch on VHF Ch16 and obtain information of other ships, warnings, etc.
- Maintain a safe distance from other ships and, if necessary, shift anchorage. c.
- ರ... Be aware of the critical wind velocity which may cause the anchor to drag.
- e. the ship, the depth of water, the nature of the sea bottom, etc., or carry out double anchoring, stand by the other anchor, and drop another anchor to check the ship's swing.
- f.. Put engines on standby if, judging from the weather and sea conditions, it is necessary.
- Make steering gear ready for immediate use. g.
- Pay out extra anchor chain and use the engine at appropriate times to prevent the h. Samu anchor from dragging.

| Authorised By | Director PFS       |

- Weather conditions shall be continuously monitored. If necessary, anchors shall be heaved well in advance of the onset of bad weather and the vessel may proceed to a safe place where a safe distance from other vessels can be maintained while drifting.
- If it is unavoidable and required to weigh anchor under unfavourable weather ﺃ. conditions, due regard shall be given to the excessive load coming on the windlass and chain. Engine power, thrusters and steering may be used to ease the load on the cable and an efficient communication shall be maintained between forward station and the bridge to closely monitor the lead and load on the anchor cable.

# 4.8 Points to be Observed when Weighing Anchor

The Master shall observe the following when weighing anchor:

- a. When the wind or current is strong, the anchor will drag as the chain is being heaved up and the ship will start to go astern. In such a case, use the engines at appropriate times to reduce the load on the windlass.
- b. When the ship's head, while heaving anchor, is in a direction excessively different from the one she intends to proceed after the anchor is up, carry out the anchor weighing operation and help her turn to the favourable direction by using the engines, thrusters and rudder in combination.
- c. When weighing anchor in swells, the windlass motors are subjected to excessive forces, so be careful to avoid causing damage.
- d. When rough weather is expected, do not lose the right opportunity to weigh anchor.

# 4.9 Anchoring other Vessels (unmanned barges/tows)

On rare occasions own vessel crew may be required by the clients/charterers to anchor other vessels (unmanned barges etc). On such occasions following procedure is to be followed :

- a. Consult client/charter's vessel operation manual (if provided).
- b. Gather all required information from the client/charterers regarding the anchors and anchoring gear available on board other vessel/barge.
- c. Calculate the maximum anchoring depth based on the lifting load and brake holding capacity of the windlass. Due regard shall be taken with regard to the condition of the windlass, anchor chain and anchors.
- d. Decide the anchoring plan having due regard to depth of water, nature of seabed, prevailing weather conditions, currents, tides, duration of stay at anchorage, etc.
- e. Carry out thorough risk assessment and tool box talk.

- 5.4.3 Pilot ladders/gangways should always be rigged according to Regulation 17, Chapter 5, of Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Regulations,

# 5.5

- 5.5.1 Navigation in restricted waters with a pilot on board is a hazardous operation.
- 5.5.2 Masters and Officers are reminded that the presence of a pilot does not relieve them of their responsibilities.
- 5.5.3 Except in the Panama Canal, the Master is fully responsible for the vessel when pilot is on board and the pilot acts in an advisory capacity only. Therefore the Master/Pilot relationship is crucial to the safe navigation of the vessel.
- 5.5.4 The OOW should draw the attention of the Pilot Card', especially the manoeuvring characteristics of the vessel. This will give the essential information on the ships characteristics that he will require.
- 5.5 In addition, the Master and the pilot shall discuss the following:
  - Intended route. a.
  - b. Speed to be used.
  - C. Navigational restrictions.
  - d. Status of navigational aids.
  - Tides, currents, visibility and weather expected. e.

{375}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_375_Picture_0.jpeg)

- Reporting procedures. ପ୍ର.
- h. Pilot change positions.
- i. Berthing arrangements.
- i. Depth of water at critical points.
- 5.5.6 Although the pilot has local knowledge, the Master is familiar with his vessel and should gain as much information as possible from publications and from the pilot in preparation for the passage.
- 5.5.7 The OOW should, at all times, maintain a plot of the vessels position and clearly indicate this on the chart.
- 5.5.8 It is the OOW responsibility to ensure that all orders are complied with, particularly helm orders. The helmsman should be monitored.
- 5.5.9 The Master must monitor the operation carefully and should be in no doubt that it is his responsibility to take over the 'con' from the pilot if he feels that the vessel is in danger or that the pilot's orders are not sound.

#### NAVIGATIONAL AIDS 6

#### 6.1 General

- 6.1.1 The OOW is responsible for reporting any deficiency to the Master.
- 6.1.2 Any maintenance required is to be done by qualified shore-based technicians.

#### 6.2 Compasses

- 6.2.1 All compasses should be serviced by an approved technician at least every two years. A record of the service should be maintained onboard.
- 6.2.2 The vessel should be 'swung' after every dry dock and at any other time when the compass deviation is considered excessive. The magnetic compass should be corrected and a 'Deviation Curve' produced. This should be clearly displayed on the bridge.
- 6.2.3 Where practicable, standard compass error is to be determined at least once a watch and, when possible, after any major alteration of course. However when the vessel is engaged in offshore operations and unable to comply with this requirement, a compass error should be taken once a day and recorded in the 'Compass Error Book'. Gyro and magnetic compass errors should be calculated.
- 6.2.4 Gyro and magnetic headings and all repeaters should be compared regularly.
- 6.2.5 If excessive errors are found, the Master must be informed so that repairs/service/adjustment can be arranged.

#### 6.3 Radars

- 6.3.1 The OOW should monitor the performance of the radars and report any deficiencies to the Master.
- 6.3.2 Every watch while the radars are in use, the OOW should compare the radar compass heading to the master gyro.
- 6.3.3 In addition, if the radar is fitted with a 'Performance Monitor' this should be tested as per the manufacturers instructions to ensure the radar is performing efficiently.

{376}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_376_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### 6.4 Whistle

6.4.1 The whistle should be tested daily at noon if this will not cause a navigational hazard or interference with offshore operations.

#### 6.5 GPS

6.5.1 Not all navigational charts are based on WGS 84 datum. There will be cases where the GPS provides a fix based on a datum different from that on the chart. In this case, the GPS position datum shift must be corrected to that of the chart datum before plotting the position on the chart.

#### Echo Sounder 6.6

- 6.6.1 The echo sounder is an invaluable aid to navigation and should be used when the depth of water is shallow or unknown.
- 6.6.2 When the vessel is at anchor and the depth of water is known from the chart, the accuracy of the echo sounder may be determined.
- 6.6.3 If the echo sounder has a paper recorder then it should be marked with a reference date & time on each occasion it is switched on.

#### 6.7 VHF

- 6.7.1 The Distress and Calling Frequency (CH16) should always be monitored at sea and when at anchor. In addition other frequencies may have to be monitored as required.
- 6.7.2 CH16 should only be used for calling or for distress/urgency/safety messages. Working channels should be used at all other times.

# 6.8 Engine, Propeller Pitch, Thrusters & Steering Controls

6.8.1 The engine, propeller pitch, thrusters and steering controls should always be tested prior to proceeding to sea.

#### 6.9 Automatic Pilot

- 6.9.1 When steering is changed from hand to automatic, the change must be supervised by an Officer and the ships course should be monitored closely.
- 6.9.2 Once per day the steering should be changed to hand to ensure the effectiveness of manual steering.

# 6.10 Automatic Identification System (AIS)

- 6.10.1 The AIS must be regularly updated with the relevant information such as :
  - whether underway or at anchor or in port
  - the number of personnel on board
  - next port / ETA
- 6.10.2 When in areas of high security risk, the AIS may be operated in accordance with internationally accepted guidelines, such as Best Management Practices (BMP).

- 6.10.3 The OOW MUST NOT use the AIS CPA and TCPA information for collision avoidance, as explained in SOLAS:
  - a Collision avoidance must be carried out in strict compliance with the COLREGs. There is no provision in the COLREGs for use of AIS information therefore decisions should be taken based primarily on visual and/or radar information.
  - b. AIS positions are derived from the target's GNSS position. (GNSS = Global Navigation Satellite System, usually GPS). This may not coincide with the radar target.
  - Faulty data input to AIS could lead to incorrect or misleading information being ن displayed on the other vessels. Mariners should remember that information derived from radar plots relies solely upon the data measured by the own-ship's radar and provides an accurate measurement of the target's relative course and speed, which is the most important factor in deciding upon action to avoid collision.

# 6.11 Voyage Data Reorder (VDR) /Simplified Voyage Data Recorder (S-VDR)

- 6.11.1 The primary purpose of the VDR / S-VDR data is to assist with Incident investigation. It is therefore important that the VDR / S-VDR data is preserved and retrieved, in a timely manner, in case of an Incident.
- 6.11.2 Most VDRs / S-VDRs are provided with means of saving and protecting approximately 12 hours of data on a Hard drive. Vessels should comply with the following
  - a. It should be always ensured that the VDR / S-VDR is always switched on and functional
  - A placard shall be displayed near the vessel's VDR / S-VDR stating the requirement to take data backup.
  - Vessel's staff shall be familiar with the maximum recording capacity of the VDR / S-ن VDR (in hours) and same shall be included in the placard.
  - Work instructions regarding saving of VDR / S-VDR data shall be displayed near the d. VDR / S-VDR.
  - e. For the particular type/make of VDR-SVDR, please confirm the module / location where data is saved. Basis the instruction manual of the particular VDR/S-VDR equipment, please prepare Working Instruction on procedure to retrieve above mentioned module (e.g. hard disk of the VDR/S-VDR where data has been saved or unit/section containing the data or entire VDR/SDVR capsule).

Use additional pages if necessary.

#### 12. UKC

Minimum UKC shall be calculated for every leg, courses shall be plotted as below guidelines:

- (a) Ocean passages 20% of the deepest draft
- (b) Fairways 15% of the deepest draft
- (c) Inside ports 10% of the deepest draft
- Canals (d)

as per local navigation rules

If vessel is towing, then the draft of tow shall be taken into account, minimum UKC for the voyage leg shall be recorded in Waypoint List.

#### SQUAT 13.

The effect of squat shall be considered as it will reduce UKC, calculation guideline as below:

Maximum Squat = $(Cb \times V^2)$ / 100 for open waters

Maximum Squat = $(Cb \times V^2)$ / 50 for confined channels

Sq: Squat in metres, Cb: Block coefficient of vessel at max navigable draft, V: Speed in knots

Calculate SQUAT for max sea speed applicable to vessel:

Open Water:

Confined Waters:

- 1.1.2. The Chief Officer is responsible for all operations on deck.

# 2. Toolbox Talk & Risk Assessment (See IMS 03)

- 2.1. The person in charge must carry out a toolbox talk with all personnel involved with the job, which must include a briefing and a risk assessment on the planned operation, prior to work commencing. The toolbox talk must be as detailed as necessary to fully inform the crew members of the proposed work program together with any unusual aspects of the jobs and any hazards that may be encountered. Particular attention should be paid to briefing new or inexperienced crew members as to the hazards associated with the operation. A risk assessment covering the proposed work program during this toolbox meeting must be completed and the required steps taken to mitigate the risks highlighted. The toolbox talk form must be signed by all personnel attending.
- 2.2. When working on deck, all personnel should keep in mind that it can be a dangerous place to be, especially if major operations are in progress. Personnel must at all times keep aware of potential hazards and bear in mind:
  - Weather conditions, especially where waves may break on deck and swamp the work a) area.
  - b) Slippery surfaces.
  - c) Wires/ropes/chain eto that may be under tension or suddenly come under tension or may move unexpectedly.
  - d) Never stand in the bight of a rope.
  - Items that are being moved or lifted never stand in position where crushing or e) injuries from falling or moving objects could occur.
  - f) Trip hazards.
  - Never sit on the ships rails or on bollards that have mooring ropes turned up on them. g)
  - h) Items on deck that could move as the ship rolls.
  - Never secure items on deck to anything other than the proper securing points; this ﯿ applies particularly to vent pipes and filling lines.
  - Maintaining good housekeeping clear up and properly stow tools and other items when the job is completed - do not leave unnecessary items on deck that could be a trip hazard.
  - k) Use the right tools for the job; never abuse tools or equipment.
  - Ensure any portable electrical equipment is the correct voltage and is in good 드 condition prior to use - check condition including the cable/plug and do not use any damaged equipment.

2.1.3. In addition, suitable wet and cold weather clothing must be available as may be necessary.

#### 3. APPROACHING & AT OFFSHORE INSTALLATION

#### 3.1. Installation Pre-arrival

- 3.1.1. Prior to arrival at any offshore installation location, the Master should ensure the following:
  - a. the vessel establishes contact with the installation and provides an ETA at least one hour before arrival;
  - the vessel does not enter the 500 metre zone without prior permission from the OlM.
  - adopt a position outside 500m zone and down weather of an installation when standing C. by awaiting instructions.

# 3.2. Before entering the 500 metre Zone

- 3.2.1. Pre-arrival checklists, reference Appendix A, for entry to any controlled area or 500 metre zone will be completed.
- 3.2.2. Any defects occurring after this initial report must be immediately reported to the installation as they occur. Continuity of operations shall be subject to agreement between the vessel Master and the installation OIM.
- 3.2.3. After completing the above, the vessel Master should formally request to enter the installation's 500 metre zone, this request should be confirmed and the time noted and entered into the vessel log book.

#### 3.3. Inside the 500 metre Zone

- 3.3.1 The vessel must always be manoeuvred at a safe speed.
- 3.3.2. Inside the 500 metre zone of any installation, the vessel must comply with the operator's procedures covering that installation. Any decisions on cargo operations will be made in conjunction with the installation OlM and the crane driver. Vessel Master, OlM and crane driver each have right of veto over any marine operation. However this does not prejudice or over-ride the Master's responsibility for the safety of his vessel and crew.

# 3.3.3. SMOKING IS PROHIBITED ANYWHERE ONBOARD THE VESSEL WHILST INSIDE THE 500 METRE ZONE.

- 3.3.4. Whilst within the 500 metre zone of an installation, the bridge must be manned as per Charterer's requirements and per the Installation requirements. Manning should also allow for 'comfort breaks' for bridge personnel whilst the vessel is connected to hoses for long periods of time.
- 3.3.5. Should equipment failure or a problem occur with the vessel's machinery/control room systems or contact be made with the installation structure, the vessel must inform the installation OlM immediately and leave the 500 metre zone as soon as practicable. The vessel will not be allowed to re-enter until the Master and OIM have satisfied themselves that remedial action has been taken to prevent a recurrence, and that the vessel is fully operational. The Charterer must also be advised of critical equipment failure either directly or via the Owners.
- 3.3.6 There must be no MF/HF transmissions or mobile phone usage whilst the vessel is inside the 500 metre zone. Should the need arise to transmit while working inside the 500 metre zone, the Master must request permission to transmit from the OlM. If permission is not granted and the urgency of the requirements, the Master must request permission to leave the 500

metre zone and make the transmission. Similarly, all VHF Radio's should be operated on low power whilst within the 500 metre zone of an installation.

# 4. HYDROGEN SULPHIDE (H2S) PROCEDURES

4.1. H2S procedures are in IMS 18.

#### 5. DP OPERATIONS

- 51 Reference
- 5.1.1. For DP operations and checklist please refer to the Dynamic Positioning Operating Procedure Manual.

#### CARGO OPERATIONS 6.

#### 6.1. General.

- 6.1.1 Please refer to Section 1 & Section 2 of this procedure for basic information for any offshore operations.
- 6.1.2. Before any lifting operations are carried out, the items to be lifted should be checked to ensure there are no loose items that may fall off, the load is properly secure and the lifting equipment is in good condition, properly secured and adequate for the job.
- 6.1.3. The item to be lifted should be fitted with taglines to control movement and the deck crew should avoid controlling the movement with their hands - "no hands on load".
- 6.1.4. Where practicable, "push pull" sticks should be used to control the movement of the load,

#### 6.2. Order of Stowage.

- 6.2.1 Where practicable, the order of loading, discharging and stowage arrangements should be preplanned in order to avoid the "slotting in of containers" and the necessity for personnel to climb on top of cargo.
- 6.2.2. Before loading, the Master should be provided with details of any unusual items of cargo, cargoes requiring special securing arrangements, heavy lifts, etc.
- 6.2.3. During back-loading at an installation, the deck crew should stand well clear and allow the crane driver to place the cargo on deck before approaching the lift to disconnect the crane. Deck crew must ensure they do not position themselves between the load and other items of cargo or other fixed objects.
- 6.2.4. Taglines must always be used when loading cargo and lifting equipment should be fitted with stingers to facilitate hooking and unhooking the lifting gear. Deck crew should never have their hands directly on the load.
- 6.2.5 Deck crew must always be aware of what is going on around them as well as being focused on the load itself. Deck crew must be aware of safe directions / areas to move in the event of an emergency. It is especially important to be aware of flooding of the deck, particularly if the vessel is stern to sea.

#### 6.3. Documentation & Marking

- 6.3.1, All cargo should be accompanied by a cargo manifest clearly identifying the goods and giving details regarding the contents, destination, general dimensions and weight. If the Master is unable to obtain full details of the cargo prior to loading at any port or back-loading at an installation, an outline list giving brief details must be drawn up to the Master's satisfaction, before loading is permitted to commence.
- 6.3.2. All dangerous cargoes must be declared to the Master, whether bound from shore to installation or vice-versa
- 6.3.3. Where shipment of dangerous cargoes is routine, special arrangement may be agreed with International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG), but Master must be fully informed of the cargoes to be carried.
- 6.3.4. All cargo must be marked so as to be readily identifiable from the manifest or outline list.
- 6.3.5. Containers should have their identification numbers clearly marked on the top so that the crane driver and bridge officer can easily identify each container.
- 6.3.6. The Master has the authority to refuse cargo if insufficient information is given, the cargo is incorrectly manifested, or if he has reason to believe that dangerous goods are contained in unmarked cargo.
- 6.3.7. The description and mass of loaded containers must be individually declared on the manifest. Operators should provide facilities at the shore base to verify masses during the loading operations. Where weighing facilities are not available, offshore installation personnel should be careful not to underestimate the weight of the individual lifts,

# 6.4. Lashing & Securing / Restraining of Cargo

- 6.4.1. Cargo must always be secured. Restraints should be in position before the vessel sails and should remain in position until immediately before each item is offloaded.
- 6.4.2. Restraining bond/lashings should be rigged so as to prevent initial movement.
- 6.4.3. When determining the type and extent of restraining arrangements required, the Master should also take into consideration the following:
  - The motion characteristics of the ship a.
  - b. The anticipated weather
  - The freeboard C.
  - d. The nature of cargo
  - The number of installations to be worked e.

#### 6.5. Deck Cargo

- 6.5.1. All deck cargo must be stowed to the satisfaction of the Master is responsible for ensuring it is correctly stowed and adequately secured for the intended voyage.
- 6.5.2. Areas on deck which are not used for cargo stowage must be clearly marked or otherwise indicated. An adequate area for handling mooring lines must be left clear of cargo at the stern of the vessel if the vessel is securing to the installation.
- 6.5.3. Where fitted, pipe posts to restrain the movement of tubulars should be used. A supply of large soft wood wedges is also useful for temporarily restraining tubulars between lifts or while installing lashings. In any event, tubulars must be properly secured.

- 6.5.5. The Master has the authority to decide the sequence of cargo discharge to, and back-loading from the installation.
- 6.5.6. In bad weather and under certain conditions of trim, a considerable amount of water may be shipped over the after deck when a vessel is approaching an installation stern-on under power. Crew members should be aware of, and alert to, this possibility and seek positions of shelter and safety.

#### 6.6. Pre-planning

- 6.6.1. Cargo pre-planning should be conducted both at the shore terminals and offshore. Pre-planning aids effective cargo securing practices. The objective of pre-sailing is the safe and practical restraint of cargo carried on deck of offshore support vessel whereby personnel, ship and cargo may be reasonably protected at all stages of carriage, and during cargo operations offshore.
- 6.6.2. It is essential therefore that liaison is established between the installation and the Master prior to unloading or back-loading of cargo.
- 6.6.3. The Master must be advised of expected delays to operations so that the vessel's work programme may be synchronised with that of the installation.
- 6.6.4 Excessive close standby/waiting time alongside the installation should be avoided,

# 6.7. Dangerous Goods & Marine Pollutants.

- 6.7.1. The carriage of dangerous goods and marine pollutants is governed by the IMDG Code and the provisions of various other State and Commonwealth Acts concerning pollution and the protection of the environment as well as health and safety.
- 6.7.2. Masters, and operators and owners of offshore installations must have available appropriate extracts of IMDG volume of reference. All requirements laid down by the IMDG Code must be followed, where applicable.
- 6.7.3. Operators and owner of offshore installation, in their capacity as shippers, must ensure that all dangerous goods and marine pollutants are properly declared, packaged and marked in accordance with the IMDG Code. The Master must ensure that all goods and pollutants are properly stowed, secured and segregated in accordance with the IMDG Code.
- 6.7.4. Master must be given advance notification prior to the loading of dangerous goods. A written declaration in the form of a Dangerous Goods Note must be delivered to the Master before the goods are taken onboard.
- 6.7.5. A Dangerous Goods Packing Certificate is required for all dangerous cargo or marine pollutants packed into containers, and cargo of this nature must be stowed and segregated in accordance with the IMDG Code. This is equally applicable to offshore back-loading.
- 6.7.6. All portable tanks used to carry dangerous and polluting substances must be approved for use by a competent authority, and tested and marked in accordance with the IMDG Code. Prior to being placed onboard, all tanks must be carefully checked for damage and leakage.
- 6.7.7. The Master should consult with the DPA/Operations Manager if in any doubt regarding shipping of the dangerous goods and marine pollutants and he has the authority to refuse to load these cargoes if the regulations are not being correctly observed.

#### 7. CARGO OPERATION AT INSTALLATION

#### 7.1. General.

7.1.1. Please refer to Section 1 & Section 2 of this procedure for basic information for any offshore operations.

# 7.2. Considerations for Cargo Operations

- 7.2.1 Cargo operations while discharging all liquids, cargo and bulk to offshore installations must be undertaken in a safe and efficient manner. In recognising this fact, the following points must be considered:
  - That the ship can approach the installation safety; a.
  - ﻗ That there are no divers, ROVs etc in the water;
  - C. That the weather/tide/current/sea and swell conditions are suitable;
  - d. The type, weight and number of units to load/discharge;
  - e. The existing cargo on deck;
  - f. If there is sufficient space on deck to allow safe access to and from the area of work;
  - g. That all engine/steering/thrusters/joystick controls have been checked and are fully operational and the main engine pitch control is fully operational;
  - h. Redundancy of essential machinery;
  - Vessel's electrical load must be carried by auxiliary alternators and is not totally reliant on shaft alternators; and
  - Hose connection points on the vessel are in good order. i.
- 7.2.2. Before proceeding with the cargo operations, the Master must satisfy himself that:
  - All emergency pump stops are operational; a.
  - The vessel is able to remain on location in the prevailing weather and sea conditions: ت
  - Consideration given to the trim of the vessel during progressive loading/unloading; c.
  - The hoses and cargo lifting arrangements are in good order, and ರ
  - Constant communication is maintained with the person on the platform responsible for e. supervising the transfer of hoses and receiving the bulk/liquids or cargo.
- 7.2.3 The vessel must advise the offshore installation of the following:
  - Maximum pumping rate; τ
  - b. Emergency stop procedure;
  - C. Notice required to stop bulk transfer under normal conditions and
  - ರ. Draining back procedure.
- 7.2.4. The platform should inform the Master of the following:
  - Size of hose connection; a.

{424}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_424_Picture_0.jpeg)

- Length of hose available; b.
- C. Maximum rate at which bulk/liquids can be received;
- ರ. Order of receiving bulk/liquids and
- Maximum back pressure that the platform pipe system can withstand. e.
- 7.2.5. When securing to the installation, crew should be made aware of:
  - a. The hazards involving with handling large mooring lines in the confined spaces normally available at the stern of a support vessel;
  - b. Cargo should not encroach on the area that is needed for the crew to operate the mooring capstans and to make the vessel fast safely. If it is necessary for a particular reason to carry deck cargo in the area that the crew require for mooring activities, such cargo should be discharged to the installation before the vessel is moored.

# 7.3. Back-loading of Cargo Offshore

- 7.3.1 All back-loading operations should be pre-planned to assist safe operations. Offloading from, and back-loading into slots ("cherry picking") should be strongly discouraged.
- 7.3.2. All tubular backloads should be indicated to the vessel in good time to allow for planning of stowage. Tubular cargoes should be pre-slung in bundles or singly and secured by bulldog grips or other equivalent methods to prevent slippage. All pipe lifts should be slung so as to be level. Varying lengths of sling in one lift should not be used. Taglines should be provided as required to increase overall safety when landing on the vessel's deck,
- 7.3.3. Tubulars must be very well secured to ensure they cannot break loose and roll around on deck. Loose tubulars on deck can be very dangerous as they can roll to one side of the vessel and upset the vessel's stability.
- 7.3.4. All cargoes to be back-loaded should be inspected by a responsible person on the installation to ensure that it is a safe and secure condition and will not create a hazard to the crew or vessel, ie :
  - a, That there are no loose items on top of or inside the cargo.
  - b That the cargo is properly slung.
  - C. That all doors, lids are properly secured.
  - ರ... That open skips or cargo baskets are fitted with nets or covers.

- 7.5.3 Crane booms, cables, fitting, foundation mountings, control cables, all safety devices and overload warning signals and limit switches are to be inspected and determined to be operating properly by the crane operator each day before starting operations. Any faults must be promptly reported to the OOW or the Master immediately.
- 7.5.4 Such an inspection by the crane operator must consist of a visual inspection for cracked welds, stranded or cut cable, bent braces, block and sheave conditions and other visual defects.
- 7.5.5 For all cargo work involving crane operations whether in port or offshore, the crane driver should have a clear view of the vessel's deck and should be stationed in a safe place. In exceptional situations where the crane driver cannot see the vessel's deck, then a trained and experienced assistant (banks man) that does have a clear view of the deck and the crane driver should be appointed and equipped with good communications.
- 7.5.6 The crane operator during operation shall always ensure that there is always minimum 6 wraps of the cable on the drum at all times.
- 7.5.7 For offshore crane operations a safety pendant ('Stinger') of sufficient length should be provided between either the headache ball or the floating block and the hook, all of which have to be high visibility colour.
- 7.5.8 For routine cargo operations offshore, only swivel self-locking safety hooks should be used. For non-routine cargo, alternative hooks or lifting gear as agreed between the Master and OIM may be used, providing that such equipment is fit for the purpose.
- 7.5.9 The crane driver offshore should have direct radio communication to the bridge of the vessel,
- 7.5.10 Directions given to the crane driver by the deck crew on the vessel must be given by only the person who has been assigned to perform that function. The crane operator must always respond to one authorised banks man, unless it is the emergency stop signal which can be given by anyone. Crane operator must always adhere to the signal code as per Appendix.
- 7.5.11 The working limitations (reach) of the crane should be formally passed to the Master prior to the operations commencing.
- 7.5.12 All heavy lift cargo should be indicated to the installation/vessel and careful planning shall be carried out prior loading/unloading.
- 7.5.13 All operations involving heavy lifts require suitable weather criteria which should be discussed and agreed prior to commencement. Other operations, bulk handling etc. may have to be suspended whilst heavy lifts are handled. Subject to agreement with the Master, taglines should be attached to heavy or large lifts, when considered necessary to aid handling.
- 7.5.14 Due account must be taken of impact loadings caused by the vertical movement of the craft in the swell when the weight of the cargo is taken by the crane.
- 7.5.15 When planning the loading ashore, containers and pre-slinging arrangements should be suitably de-rated to take account of the expected sea conditions during discharge at the offshore terminal.

- 7.5.16 As far as practicable, all crane lifts made from or to a supply vessel should not be lifted directly over the vessel if the height of the lift above the vessel exceeds 3 metres inclusive of any swell which may be in existence. Once the height of the lift exceeds 3 metres, the remainder of the lift should be made over water.
- 7.5.17 When leaving the crane after operations, the crane operator shall ensure:
  - a) leave all controls in the "Off" position
  - b) Return unloaded hooks to the top position
  - c) switch off and remove the key

#### 7.6. Bulk Transfer Procedures

- 7.6.1. Agreed procedures covering the transfer of all bulk products should be followed.
- 7.6.2 Prior to start of operations, hoses should be visually inspected and doubtful lengths replaced. Slings and lifting points should also be visually checked and replaced if required. Hoses are only to be lifted by a certified wire stop on a certified hook eye fitting.
- 7.6.3 The following information should be requested by the Installation (or by the Master if bulk is to be transferred from the Installation to the vessel) :
  - Estimated pumping rate for each product. a)
  - Length of warning / estimate of time required to stop. b)

  - Maximum loading rate / pressure permitted. d)
  - e) Quantities of each product required, the order in which they are required, and an estimate of the time at which they will be required.
- 7.6.5 When the hose is connected and installation lines are set, the supply vessel should be directed to start pumping at a slow rate. For dry bulk transfers, purge air to be utilised prior to bulk transfer to clear lines and prove connections.
- 7.6.6 If all is well and no leaks are observed, the supply vessel should be advised to increase pumping up to the fully delivery rate.
- 7.6.7 When pumping has finished, both the installation and the supply vessel should set their lines to allow the hose to be drained back to the vessel's tank. If the installation has a vacuum breaker fitted to the line, this should be used to aid draining.
- 7.6.8 Lines may also be blown through with air, if available, to ensure that they are properly cleared. In suitable conditions the crane should also be used to lift the hose to aid draining.
- 7.6.9 When the hose is disconnected, the end should be fitted with a cap or blank. Every bulk liquid hose should, as far as practicable, be drained back to the vessel's tank(s).
- 7.6.10 Hoses used for potable water should not be used for transferring other bulk liquids, including ordinary fresh water.

{427}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_427_Picture_0.jpeg)

- 7.6.12 All bulk hoses used offshore are to be type approved by the appropriate certifying authority.
  - 7.6.13 All bulk hoses used offshore are to be sufficient length for safe operation, and have internally swaged or other approved clamp fittings. Unapproved repairs must not be made.
  - 7.6.14 Consideration should be given to the use of hose floats, where practicable, and where agreed by masters and installation personnel. If used, they must be correctly fitted to the appropriate portion of the hose system and be hi-visible in colour.
  - 7.6.15 Passing hoses to vessels is a hazardous operation and it must be supervised by a responsible person on the installation with direct communication to the vessel Master.
  - 7.6.16 During the period a vessel is connected to bulk hoses, continuous radio communication must be maintained, and the crane driver must remain in his cab until agreed otherwise. Also, relevant installation personnel should stand by appropriate valves so as to act quickly in event of an emergency.

#### 8. RIG TOWING OPERATIONS

#### 8.1. General

- 8.1.1 Please refer to Section 1 & Section 2 of this procedure for basic information for any offshore operations.
- 8.1.2. Towing has the potential to be a hazardous operation. Offshore personnel should be aware of the operational limitations of the various vessels utilised, including their power and freeboard, with the safety of crews being of paramount importance,

# 8.2. Agreed Procedures and Responsibilities

- 8.2.1 Full procedures for towing operations must be agreed by operators and the Mobile Installation Contractors and clear instructions laid down in writing. Where particular installations have detailed procedures for towing, these must be passed to the relevant vessels via the operator as required as that the Masters are fully briefed on the operation to be conducted. If possible, the Master should be briefed prior to leaving port but most certainly on location prior to the towing operations.
- 8.2.2 These procedures must identify the responsibilities of key personnel.
- 8.2.3. It must clearly be established in writing who is in charge of the tow. Normally the person in charge will be the one of the tug masters who should be appointed as Lead Tug Master by the operator in writing. His responsibility should be stipulated in writing and his responsibilities clearly laid down.
- 8.2.4 The Master of each vessel is responsible for the maintenance and use of the ship's own equipment.
- 8.2.5. The owner and the operator of the installation are responsible for all installation equipment, including equipment hired specifically for the move, and all towing gear on the installation.
- 8.2.6. Where vessels are engaged in towing operations, a system to prevent tow-line chafing should be adopted.

#### 8.3. Equipment.

- 8.3.1. A safe method of passing the main towing pendent from the installation to the towing vessel should be established, with a clear understanding of the procedures to be used by all parties.
- 8.3.2. If a messenger is used to pass the tow-wire to the towing vessel, it should be of adequate strength to support the entire weight of the towing bridle, and fore-runner or at least long enough to allow an adequate strength messenger to be on the winch of the towing vessel before the weight of the gear is taken. Recovery wires led to the towing vessel's equipment during connection/disconnection but these should not be so taut that they hold the weight of the gear above the water level or in any other way pose a danger to the towing vessel crew. The installation crew must take instruction from the towing vessel Master as to the use of these winches.
- 8.3.3. As soon as the towing vessels is connected and commences towing operations, winches on the vessel being towed (if used in the towing gear) must be continuously manned during the initial stage of the tow, and be under control of the towing vessel's Master.
- 8.3.4. Once the tow is safety connected, the crew should 'clear the deck' and stay clear until the tow is streamed to towing length and the Master authorises fitting gear or other necessary maintenance.

#### 8.4. Inspection.

8.4.1 The towing equipment must be inspected by a competent officer of the vessel before connection to ensure that there are no apparent defects that may affect the safety of the tow.

# 8.5. Clear Decks, Towing Operations JCO

- 8.5.1. Vessels involved in towing should have decks as clear as possible with no cargo or other equipment encroaching on the area of the deck covered by the tow wire between its extremes of possible movement.
- 8.5.2. Any equipment that is not necessary for the tow should be discharged back to the installation and anything carried on deck during the tow is to be carried at the discretion of the towing vessel Master. Such discretion should only be exercised when material that is proposed to be carried cannot impede the free movement of the tow-wire or the crew during work necessary for the conduct of the tow.

#### 8.6. Reserve Tow Equipment

- 8.6.1. The secondary towing system on an installation should be identified, a readiy available method of retrieval of the main towing gear established and a safe method of passing the secondary towing system agreed.
- 8.6.2. Towing vessels engaged in long tows where there is only a single towing vessel should carry a complete set of spare gear to enable reconnection in the event of failure. This will normally be a requirement of the underwriters in any case.
- 8.6.3. Where possible, spare tow-wires should be stored permanently on powered drums as this greatly assists the crew should the spare tow-wire be required to be installed. Spare tow-wires should be stowed on the drums with the bitter end outward.
- 8.6.4. Towing vessels should ensure that the installation personnel are aware of the time that may be required to rig their spare towing wire. When an additional vessel is available as reserves tug whilst on passage, it should be rigged for towing.

8.6.5 All crew must be fully briefed on the procedure for installing the spare tow gear and reconnecting as this is normally required to be done in adverse conditions when hazards are greater than normal and mistakes can be made due to undue haste.

#### 8.7. Manned Tow.

- 8.7.1. It is the responsibility of the personnel onboard the towed vessel to maintain the proper navigation signals on a manned tow and to follow the instructions issued by the tow Master.
- 8.7.2. It is the responsibility of the personnel onboard the towing vessel to maintain the vessel properly ballasted and trimmed and not to make changes without the prior knowledge and agreement of the Master of the tug.
- 8.7.3. There should be a continuous communication link on a dedicated channel established and maintained between the tug and tow for the duration of the tow.

#### Unmanned Tow. 8.8.

- 8.8.1 The Master or officer of the towing vessel must inspect the towing arrangement of unmanned tows to familiarise himself with the layout of both main and reserve towing gear on the vessel to be towed and to have any apparent defects corrected before connection.
- 8.8.2. The Master or officer of the towing vessel must also check that the navigation lights of the vessels to be towed are working and have sufficient capacity to last the entire length of the proposed tow.
- 8.8.3. A officer of the towing vessel should inspect any machinery that may be fitted to the other vessel to be towed en ensure that side valves, watertight doors and any other hull openings are closed and that the towed vessels is in all respects ready for the proposed tow, properly ballasted and trimmed.
- 8.8.4. The reserved towing gear must be rigged so that it can be recovered by the tug crew without having to board the tow. This normally means a floating line streamed astern of the tow connected to the reserve towing gear.
- 8.8.5. The Master of the towing vessel should also satisfy himself that sea fastenings on any cargo that the towed vessel is carrying are adequate for the intended tow.
- 8.8.6. The operator, owner or charter of the towed vessel or installation must make good any deficiencies noted by the Master prior to connecting the tow.

# 9. ANCHOR HANDLING AND INSTALLATION SHIFTS

#### 9.1. General

- 9.1.1. Handling installation anchors at sea can be a particularly hazardous and demanding task. No formal hard and fast rules can be laid down for anchoring handling/towing operations, as so many variable factors apply. Offshore personnel should be aware of the operational limitation of the various vessels utilised, including their power and freeboard, with the safety of crew being of paramount importance.
- 9.1.2. Offshore installation personnel should ensure that, whenever pendants are passed to vessel close alongside, crane drivers are competent to undertake this operation. The operation should be adequately supervised.
- 9.1.3. Any equipment returned to the installation as suspect or unserviceable must not be used or sent back to a vessel for use until it has been repaired, retested and recertified by a proper authority.

{430}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_430_Picture_0.jpeg)

- 9.1.4. As anchor handling is almost invariably performed over the stern, crew members must be made aware of the hazards associated with seas coming aboard during the operations. All precautions should be taken to avoid injury from crewmembers being washed across the deck by seas coming onboard. The Master has the authority to cease operations if the weather is such that there is significant risk of injury due to boarding seas.
- 9.1.5 in attendance, the standby vessel should be informed of all operations in progress.

# 9.2. Agreed Procedures, Written Program, Briefing of Master, Responsibilities.

- 9.2.1 Full procedures for installation move operations must be agreed by operators and their OIM and clear instructions laid down in writing. Where particular installations have detailed procedures for anchor-handling and towing, these must be passed to the relevant vessels via the operator as required, so that Masters are fully briefed on the operation to be conducted. If possible, Masters should be briefed prior to leaving port, or failing that, on location prior to installation move operations.
- 9.2.2. The procedures must identify the responsibilities of key personnel and identify who is the person in charge of the move.
- 9.2.3. The Master of each vessel is responsible for the maintenance and use of the ship's own equipment.
- 9.2.4. The owner and operator of the installation is responsible for the installation equipment, including equipment hired specifically for the move
- 9.2.5 There should be agreement as to the responsibility for providing mooring equipment for the move and as to the amount and specification of such equipment, taking account of the anticipated holding ground on location.
- 9.2.6. Sufficient piggyback anchors, buoys, associated pendant systems, shackles and other spare gear should be available in the field as required.

#### 9.3. Communication

- 9.3.1. See Section 1.2 on Master / OIM Information Exchange and Communications
- 9.3.2. Effective communication between the Masters, the installation staff and the vital for safety. For this reason adequate numbers of key personnel should be proficient in the English language. Only English should be used on the radio during operations to avoid hazardous confusion.
- 9.3.3. An effective radio communication link between the installation on a nominated channel should be maintained at all times whilst the vessel is engaged in anchor handling and/or towing operations. The channels should be clear of other operations to avoid congestion and delay in issuing instructions.
- 9.3.4. The Master engaged in anchor handling operations must be notified of any expected helicopter movements to or from the installation during such operations.
- 9.3.5. The Master should question any instructions or procedures that he feels are not consistent with the capabilities of the vessel, good practice or that may compromise the safety of the crew vessel or installation.

# 9.4. Pipelines, Sub-sea Obstructions/Structures

9.4.1. All personnel involved must have full details regarding the location of pipelines and sub-sea obstructions/structures relating to the whole operation.

| Issued by     | DPA                |
| Authorised By | Director PFS       |

9.4.2. Where it is known that anchor handling and/or towing operations will be conducted near to pipelines or sub-sea obstructions/structures, then full written procedures should be agreed by all parties.

# 9.5. Clear Decks, Anchor Handling Operations.

- 9.5.1. Anchor handling vessels should have clear decks prior to commencing anchor handling operations. All cargo and equipment not needed for use during the move should be discharged back to the installation prior to commencing operations.
- 9.5.2. Installation deck loads should be pre-planned to ensure that it is necessary for support vessels to carry cargo or equipment that is not needed for the anchor handling operation.

#### Removal of Clutter 9.6.

- 9.6.1. Equipment, such as buoys, anchors, pennants etc. accumulated on the deck during the operations should be discharged back to the installation at regular intervals to avoid the hazards associated with the accumulation of clutter on the vessel's working deck.
- 9.6.2. Installation deck loads should be pre-planned to ensure that there is sufficient space and capacity to allow this excess gear to be returned to the installation.

# 9.7. Carriage of Spare Anchor Buoy

9.7.1 Each vessel engaged in anchor handling operations should carry anchor buoy on deck throughout the work in order that the vessel's work wire can be buoyed off should the need arise, e.g. if the weather deteriorates during anchor handling operations and it is not considered prudent to bring the vessel back alongside to recover the chasing pendant, or if the vessel suffers a mechanical breakdown which restricts its ability to manoeuvre safety alongside the installation.

#### 9.8. Winch Drum Visibility.

- 9.8.1 On all anchor handling vessel it is imperative for safety that the winch driver has a clear view of the winch drum that is being operated. It is preferable that the Master also has a clear view of the drum. Both the Master and winch driver should have a clear view of the working deck.
- 9.8.2. Where video cameras are installed to provide a view of the winch drum, these and the associated lighting, must be positioned so as to give the best view possible. The video system should be maintained so that the winch driver always has a clear view of the drum.
- 9.8.3. In an emergency or due to system breakdown, it may be necessary to operate the winches using a crew member as observer at the drum using a radio or hand signals to communicate direct with the winch driver. If this is necessary, the observer should be so placed that he is not in any danger from the winch or the equipment being wound/off. Hand signals should be agreed prior to the operation and all personnel fully briefed as to requirements.

#### 9.9. Personnel Clear of Deck in Protected Area

- 9.9.1. All personnel should be cleared off the deck and in a protected place at all times, except when they are actually working on the anchor handling equipment.
- 9.9.2. The anchor-handling winch should not normally be operated until all personnel are clear of the deck.

{432}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_432_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### 9.10. Equipment

- 9.10.1 . In order to maintain a safe working environment of all personnel onboard, the following points should be addressed:
  - a. There should be in place a safe and effective method of "stopping" wire pendants.
  - b. The operation and maintenance of all equipment should be in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions and good practice.
  - A suitable system should be in placed for the testing, inspection, maintenance and C. recording of anchor handling equipment retained onboard vessels and installations. A means for recording the results and frequency of such work should be used.
  - d. Particular attention should be paid when using soft eye pendants as they wear more quickly than hard eye pendants and require frequent inspection. Hard eye pendants are also subject to distortion in the thimbles which may render them unusable or unsafe. If doubt exists as to the suitability of the pendant, it should be returned to the rig and replaced.
  - e. Hard eye or soft eye wires with a "Talurit' or sleeve (ferrule) type termination should not be used in a mechanical stopper where the sleeve bears the weight against the stopper jaws or inserts. Wire pendants may be supported in mechanical stoppers by attaching five links or anchor chain to the pendant of forming three links of anchor chain with the thimble and using a chain link in the mechanical stopper.
  - f. All equipment used in anchor handling operations should be secured until required.
  - Care should be taken when opening up wire coils, in particular pendants wires, as g. injuries have occurred by the spring open of the coils following release of the securing bands.
  - h. When running anchors, the Master should be advised where the installation winches have payout limitations so that speed can be controlled. Effective communication should be established between the Master and the winch driver.
  - i. . . . It is preferable to have a length of chain installed between the crown of the anchor and the pendant and this chain should be long enough to reach the vessel securing device and thus allow crew to change pendants without the necessity to deck the anchor.

# 9.11. Weather Limitations - Responsibilities (also refer to Section 1.7 of this procedure)

9.11.1. Weather forecasts are to be available during all rig movement operations planned accordingly. In marginal weather conditions, the Master of each vessel and the person in charge of the move should agree to terminate/commence operations. Ultimately, the Masters of each vessel has the responsibility to decide whether or not conditions allow his vessel to operate safely.

# 9.12. Loading/ / Unloading Rigs Whilst Underway.

9.12.1, Due to the effects of interaction between two moving vessels, all forms of cargo work/transferring of equipment between mobile offshore units/vessels when both are underway should be avoided.

#### 9.13. Chain Chasing

9.13.1. This operation should be performed using the recommended amount of wire for the depth of water and using the methods recommended by manufacturer.

| Authorised By | Director PFS       |

- 9.13.2. To avoid picking up bights of chain/wire with consequent overloading of the gear, tension should be maintained by the installation on the anchor chain/wire until the vessel has run the full distance and is ready to commence heaving.
- 9.13.3. The vessel should be kept directly over the line of the anchor cable while chasing to avoid overloading of the equipment.
- 9.13.4. In all cases, the crew should be off the deck and in a protected location during chasing operations.

#### 9.14. Grappling

- 9.14.1. Care should be taken deploying grapples and U' hooks over the stern. If the weight suddenly comes on the pendant wire, it may whip across the deck.
- 9.14.2. Excessive power or speed may cause sudden overloading on equipment when the grapple or 'U' hook encounters the cable.

#### 9.15. Recovering Anchors

- 9.15.1. Care should be taken when lifting anchors, especially those that are deeply embedded in the seabed, to avoid as much as possible sudden heavy loads on the pendant string from the rise and fall for the vessel in the seaway.
- 9.15.2. If it is necessary to deck an anchor, it should be secured on deck such that it cannot move due to the movement of the vessel

#### Multiple Pendants 9.16.

9.16.1 Care should be taken when slowing multiple pendants on the winch drum to avoid fouled pendants when the wire is unwound. If 'bow' type shackles are used, they should be placed so that the pin is toward the winch as this reduces the possibility of fouling behind the pin when the wire is unwound under load.

# 9.17. Length of Pendant from Installation

9.17.1 The length of pendant that is passed to the vessel from the installation should be sufficient to allow the Master room to manoeuvre to keep the pendant slack while it is being connected to the work-wire/pendant by the deck crew.

#### 9.18. Anchor Deployment

- 9.18.1. The vessel should be held in line with the anchor cable while the anchor is deployed and until the buoy is in the water so that the pendant is laid out in a straight line away from the anchor, reducing as much as possible the hazards associated with fouled anchors.
- 9.18.2. The installation should tension the cables as soon as possible after the anchor is on the bottom to 'set' the anchor below the seabed and thus avoid fouled anchors.

#### 9.19. Buoy Deployment.

9.19.1. Buoys should be deployed from as close to the vessel as possible to avoid an uncontrolled and damaging progression along the length of the deck.

# 9.20. Passing Pendant to Installation

9.20.1. Care should be taken that the pendant is not released from the securing device on deck until the crane has taken the weight as this can lead to unacceptable shock loads on the crane.

{434}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_434_Picture_0.jpeg)

# 9.21. Clearing Fouled Anchors

- 9.21.1 Crewmembers should be aware that coils of pendant wire fouling an anchor may move sharply as they are cleared. Clearing should be accomplished as much as possible using tuggers and other mechanical means.
- 9.21.2. Pendant wires that have been cleared from a fould be closely inspected for damage before a decision is made as to whether they are suitable for use. If there is damage to the wire sufficient to render it suspect, the wire should be marked 'unserviceable' and returned to the installation where it should be quarantined and marked 'Out of Service'.

# 9.22 Safety Consideration for Anchor Handling Operations

- A) Ensure that all risks have been properly assessed (Risk Assessment process),
- B) Ensure all Safety and Operational Procedures are in place prior to carrying out the Anchor Handling Work and that they are fully and properly complied with.
- C) Ensure all operational activities are properly planned between the Anchor Handling Tug and the vessel for which anchors are being handled.
- D) Ensure communications are good and tested between the Anchor Handling Tug and the vessel for which the anchors are being handled, with a clear understanding between the persons in charge on both vessels.
- E) forward of the Main Tow Winch into the accommodation and the Engine-room/Steering Flat Escape Hatch) are properly closed prior to the anchor handling work commencing, and remain closed throughout the anchor handling operations.
- F) Ensure there are sufficient trained and experienced personnel available to carry out the anchor handling operations, especially with regard to the conning of the vessel and deck activities and particularly if operations are likely to continue for extended periods. If necessary, request additional personnel to avoid fatigue and ensure adequate rest periods. During operations the bridge has to be manned with at least 2 watch keepers including master.
- G) Ensure all personnel are properly briefed (Toolbox Talk), trained, experienced and capable of carrying out their assigned tasks, and they are equipped with and using the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment.
- H) Ensure that all operations (especially winching operations), vessel movements and manoeuvres are carried out at a safe speed.
- Ensure the Anchor Handling Tug is correctly trimmed and has adequate stability (GM) for the anchor handling work being done.
- J) Ensure Anchor Handling Guidelines (Client's Guidelines as appropriate and Guidelines for the Safe Management of Offshore Supply and Anchor Handling Operations (NWEA) are properly complied with.

# IF IN DOUBT, STOP THE JOB!

#### 10. BARGE WORK

#### 10.1. General

- 10:1.1. Please refer to Section 1 & Section 2 of this procedure for basic information for any offshore operations.
- 10.1.2. As this is done using a very short tow-wire and normally necessitates large alternations of course and variations in power applied, it is important that all crew remain off the work deck in an area clear of any possible hazard once the tow is connected.

# 10.2. Hipping Up

- 10.2.1. Hipping up to the barge for close handling work requires considerable tension to be applied to the tug mooring lines if it is to be done effectively. The crew must be properly briefed prior to hipping up so that they are aware of the particular hazards associated with this operation.
- 10.2.2. Hipping up at sea presents additional hazards due to movement caused by sea and swell and deck crew should exercise great care when handling mooring lines to avoid injuries.
- 10.2.3. Consideration must be given to the limitations imposed by the shape of the vessel and the effect that any movement in the seaway will have on the safety of the operation. In most circumstances, support vessels are not designed with sufficiently straight sides and bow or with sufficient structural strength in this area to allow hipping up vessels in a situation where movement in the seaway between the vessels may occur.

#### 10.3. High Wire Hazard

10.3.1. Crews must be made aware of the hazard presented by a high wire when working close to a barge with a high bow and short bridle and fore-runner. This may cause the towing gear to rise and fall from the work deck if weight unexpectedly comes on the wire during connection/disconnection. No attempt should be made to work on the wire cable while it is off the deck or when there is any weight on the gear.

# 11. WORK OVERSIDE OR ON BUOYS

#### 11.1. Work Overside

- 11.1.1. Work to be carried out over the side of the vessel or from an area where there are no handrails and there is a risk of crew falling into the water, should be the subject of a work permit.
- 11.1.2. Appropriate safety equipment such as lifelines, work vests or life jackets, safety helmets etc. must always be worn by crew members working over the side, whether at sea or at port.
- 11.1.3. Equipment used in this work must be in good condition and the rigging supervised by a competent person.
- 11.1.4. A means of escape, such as a ladder properly secured must be rigged and accessible to those working over the side for the duration of the work.

# 11.2. Work on Buoys

- 11.2.1. Weather conditions as well as other factors will dictate if it is safely possible to perform work on buoys in the water. The Master is responsible for the decision to proceed having taken due regard of the particular circumstances.
- 11.2.2. As with work over the side, work vest or lifejackets and lifelines as well as other standard safely clothing should be worn should it be necessary for crew members to work on buoys in water.

{436}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_436_Picture_0.jpeg)

- 11.2.3. The particular hazards associated with this work must be fully explained to crew members prior to operations and the objectives and means to achieve them fully discussed and understood.
- 11.2.4. The means of access for the buoy must be carefully considered prior to the operation taking place. In most cases, the workboat is considered to be the safest. Jumping in any form is to be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
- 11.2.5. Each crew member on the buoy must have a short length of rope that can be secured to the buoy and used as a holding point to steady against the movement of the buoy in the water or jolts from contact with the vessel or transfer boat.
- 11.2.6. Care must be taken to avoid contact between the vessel or its propeller wash and the buoys if it is necessary for operations to be conducted at close quarters while the buoy is manned.

#### STANDBY VESSEL 12.

#### 12.1. General

- 12.1.1. The duties of standby vessels must be laid down in the Client's Operational Procedures to avoid confusion as to what is expected of the standby vessel. Copies of operational procedures should be available on dedicated standby vessels as well as on any other support vessel that may be required to take over the duties of the standby vessel at particular times.
- 12.1.2. The time of taking over and being relieved of standby duty should be noted in the log and the vessel last appointed as standby should remain in that capacity until officially relieved of the duty.
- 12.1.3. Standby vessels on duty must have adequate clear deck space for any foreseeable emergency and to cope with the duties as laid down. Adequate clear deck space would normally mean that not more than one third of the deck space is taken up with cargo or material and that there is access for the full length of the deck. Both port and starboard rescue zones must be kept clear.
- 12.1.4. Vessels required to perform other duties should be officially relieved of the standby duty by another vessel before conducting other operations. A vessel performing cargo operations, surveys, anchor handling or towing should not also be expected to be the standby vessel.
- 12.1.5. The Client's Operational Procedures should detail particular operations that require a vessel on close standby and all such operations should be suspended if a vessel is not available to perform the function.

#### 12.2. Special Equipment

- 12.2.1. The Client's Operational Procedures should set out in detail any special equipment that is required to be carried by the standby vessel. Such equipment should also be available on board any other support vessel before it is engaged as the standby vessel.
- 12.2.2. Any special equipment supplied to vessels for the standby role should have full operating instructions to enable vessel crews to operate the equipment safely and efficiently for its intended purpose.

#### 12.3. Recue Craft/Fast Rescue Craft

- 12.3.1. Standby vessels should have a rescue craft and trained crew ready for immediate use at all times while the vessel is the designated standby vessel.
- 12.3.2. The rescue craft must be of a type approved for the purpose and maintained in a fit condition for use. Rescue craft operation weather guidelines are provided in appendix of this section.

{437}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_437_Picture_0.jpeg)

12.3.3. Crews assigned to rescue craft should be regularly exercised in a variety of conditions to ensure that the response time and efficiency is as good as possible. Records of various training and drills should be maintained on board.

# 12.4. Blankets and Protective Equipment

12.4.1. These should be stowed in an accessible place where they are protected from deterioration.

#### 12.5. Communications

- 12.5.1. There should be a continuous communications link on a dedicated channel between the standby vessel and the control/operations room on the installation. There should be a person in attendance at all times both on board and on the installation.
- 12.5.2. Where the standby vessel is positioned for the protection of people undertaking a specific job (for instance, close standby for people working in the 'moonpool' of a drilling rig) there should be a continuous communications link with the person supervising the job on the installation in addition to the normal communications as above.
- 12.5.3. The standby vessel should also be informed of operations that will require specific attention well in advance to enable necessary preparations to be made. Helicopter schedules should be advised to the standby vessel in advance or as soon as they are known.

# 13. TRANSFER OF PERSONNEL

# 13.1. Transfer of Personnel by Personnel Basket

- 13.1.1 The following procedures should be strictly adhered to for the safe transfer of personnel from ship to rig by "personnel baskets":
  - a. two seamen should keep the equipment steady when it is lowered to the deck;
  - ﻓ luggage should be secured within the net of the basket;

Predictions are generally given for significant and maximum wave heights by meteorological departments. The sea state is a mix of ever changing troughs and crests and in general there is no symmetry and repetition of their pattern. If these were plotted for some duration, a random wave pattern may emerge as reflected in above picture (Fig 2).

The smaller waves are ignored and more concentration is given to larger ones. These larger waves make up to approximately one third of all waves. The other two third waves are ignored as they are too small to create an impact.

Significant wave height: Average height of one third of the waves over a 20 minute period.

Maximum wave height: Height of the highest wave in a 20 minute period.

#### Purpose and 1 - 110

- 1.1. SR MARINE Fleet Services Pte. Ltd. has developed this Emergency Response Procedure (ERP) which is applicable to all Company vessels and provides guidance to assist the vessel's Master and operational personnel in dealing with all aspects of emergencies. This ERP Manual contains information to handle an emergency and to take the necessary actions to stop or minimise damage and to mitigate the effects of an emergency.
- 1.2. This ERP also addresses the upward notification and reporting to the Company Senior Management and other relevant Company personnel. The notification and reporting is through the DPA and/or alternate DPA.
- 1.3. This ERP is authorised by the Director SR MARINE Fleet Services (PFS) who authorises the designated DPA to act as the link on matters of safety between the Fleet and senior management.

# 2. Scope Scope I L . Scope 1 1

- 2.1 . This ERP addresses the safeguarding of life & property, the minimisation of environmental impact and ensuring as far as possible the continuous safe operation of the vessel in the event of an onboard emergency.
- 3. Location of Company Shore Based Response Team Coordination Centre and Company

The Shore Response Team Coordination Centre is located at the below-mentioned Shipyard Road address and will be convened in as and when necessary.

| Issued by     | DPA                |
| Authorised By | Director PFS       |

# 4. RESPONSIBILITY

- 4.1 an event of an emergency involving a company vessel (or tow), the Master is fully in-charge of all shipboard operations. The Master's priority will focus on the safety of personnel and vessel and to take actions to prevent the escalation of the emergency. Subject to the exigencies of the incident, an immediate initial verbal notification to the DPA (or the alternate DPA) must be initiated at the earliest opportunity (within 30 minutes) in order to enable the DPA to assist the vessel in handling the emergency.
- 4.2. The DPA will inform the senior management including Corporate legal and Insurance Department. This is to ensure that the senior management are appraised of the situation and any advice from Legal and Insurance department is complied with in order to protect the vessel's and the Company's interests.
- 4.3. The ERP is for handling emergency situations using whatever resources and assets that are available. When necessary, DPA will activate the Shore Response Team (SRT). The Shore Commander (Overall in-charge of the SRT) will assess the emergency and determine the response level. Assets from the company and/or third party assets where available and applicable may then be mobilised to assist the distressed vessel depending on the response level and advice from the SRT members.
- 4.4. All company assets will fall under the control of the Shore Commander. External assets such as government vessels may not fall under the control of the Shore Commander but, where possible, a link will be established between the distressed vessel and the non-company assets.
- 4.5 On scene, the Master (or his designated or the designated On-Scene Commander will be fully incharge of the emergency response operation. Where available, all assets will assist the vessel as required.
- 4.6 Where it is necessary for personnel evacuation from a Company vessel at sea, refer to the International Aeronautical Martime Search and Rescue (IAMSAR) Manual for guidance in coordination with Maritime Rescue assets and Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC).

# 5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE LEVELS

- 5.1. The ERP uses the concept of tiered response. The response level is divided into 3 levels of response, (level 1, 2, and 3) to classify the severity of the emergency. These response levels also provide an indication to the resources to be mobilised and deployed. However, this is subject to the availability of assets from within the company and external parties' involvement.
- 5.2. The following response levels would be used to determine the severity of the emergency and the resources to be mobilised and deployed :

Level 1: This is for an emergency where the situation is controllable and can be managed effectively by utilising the vessel's own capability and on-board resources.

Level2: This requires a combination of the vessel's own capability and the support of additional company assets, where available. At this level, the emergency may have serious consequences to lives, property, environment and assets. The situation may be contained by company assets or sub-contracted on-site resources.

Level3: This response requires a full turn-out of all resources: from own vessel, support of additional company assets (if available) and the involvement of third parties and government response organisations. In this level, the emergency is threatening to affect or has affected lives, environment or assets that may warrant evacuation of the crew.

The Emergency Contact List will also be available in the Shore Response Team Coordination Centre.

As and when applicable, Vessel with Charter's emergency contact list for the current project, which shall be clearly displayed on bridge next to the SR MARINE contact list.

- 6.3. The DPA (or his designate) will be the key person ashore in handling the response operation. If necessary, he will communicate directly to and from the vessel, although keeping the appropriate Divisional Director, SR MARINE Semco informed. Where vessels are involved in project work where there is a Project ERP, the DPA will also work in liaison with the Project Director or his designate.
- 6.4. The Initial notification Checklist will be initially used in disseminating of information from the vessel to the SRT. This will provide the essential information that is required for SRT to work out a suitable plan to assist the vessel.
- 6.5. Communication with External Parties (other than media): If the nature of the emergency involves external government agencies or other assisting vessels rendering assistance to the vessel, the on-scene Commander should establish communications with the external parties.

# 7. CRISIS MANAGEMENT

7.1 Communication with the Media: Depending on the nature of the emergency, it may potentially generate great interest with the general public. Contacts with the media are the responsibility of the Director PFS (or designate) in consultation with the SR MARINE Semco Divisional Director. If necessary, a Team of Company Management Personnel will be convened to address media issues, including press releases, press conferences etc. This Team may include but not be limited to appropriate representation from PFS and SR MARINE Semco.

#### 7.2 Responding to the Media

# a. Preparation of Policy Statements

When preparing policy statements, the following general principles should be considered :

- · When responding to a crisis situation, the response should be honest, timely and direct. Having a prepared, approved and distributed policy statement will help to resist the temptation to say "no comment" which may result in the company appearing to be uncooperative or secretive during a crisis situation.
- · Do the right thing, being fair to all parties to the best of your ability.

# b. Preparing Specific Responses (such as Press Releases)

After a crisis scenario has been identified, specific responses should be prepared,

Consider the following checklist when drafting press releases :

- · Define the scope of the crisis local, regional, national or international,
- · Establish a unified response one spokesperson established to distribute statements to the media, etc.
- · Keep the message simple, clear, consistent and tailored to each audience.

Understand that the media wants primarily to know three things :

- what happened? .
- . why did it happen?
- · what are you going to do to make sure that it never happens again?

In addition to the policy statements & press releases, anticipate media questions that may be asked.

List the questions with developed answers that the crisis team is comfortable with and continually update the list as new questions are identified. Team members should have immediate access to each other at all times in the event of a crisis.

Finally, the news media must be briefed on a regular basis. All phone calls from the media must be answered quickly and completely. Keep media logs listing the date and time, source, reporter, phone number and the questions asked.

Stick to your core message and deliver that message to everyone. Bear in mind that Social Media issues may also need to be similarly addressed.

# c. Post - Crisis Review

The crisis management process does not end once a crisis has occurred and been resolved.

Each situation should be carefully evaluated in terms of:

- the media coverage received .
- · the resulting image of the Company
- · the development of short and long term programmes to rebuild image
- · reviewing position statements for relevance and necessary revisions.

# 8. EXTERNAL SUPPORT SERVICES

#### 8.1 Medical Support

In addition to the standard Radio medico advice available through GMDSS, SR MARINE has a contracted support arrangement with shore-based Healthcare Service Providers in Singapore to provide medical support to all its employees, both shore-based and seagoing,

The services provided include real-time medical advice whereby the Master of a vessel can correspond or even speak directly with the Duty Medical Practitioner, especially in urgent cases of injury or illness where delay could cause further deterioration in a patient's condition.

Regular contact is maintained between the Crewing Department and the shore-based Healthcare Service Providers in Singapore to ensure the contacts remain current.

#### 8.2 Emergency Exercises

A table top exercise between Shore and Ship shall be conducted at least once a year to ensure adequate response at any time to hazards, accidents and emergency situations on board ships.

Such exercises may involve external parties (e.g. Port State, Flag State) and, on completion of the table top drill, an analysis shall be conducted and respective flag state forms completed if so required.

The exercise will be coordinated at the head office by SRT with a designated vessel.

# 10. SHIPBOARD EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES

#### 10.1. General

10.1.1. The Master and OOW must be fully conversant with the emergency checklist and should know what initial action to take in response to emergencies. See all the emergency checklists contained in the Appendices.

#### Master Responsibility 10.2.

- 10.2.1, The Master is ultimately responsible for his crew, vessel and towltows at all times and in the event of an accident, he is in charge of the seaborne operation.
- 10.2.2. The Master has overriding authority and responsibility to make decisions, with respect to safety and pollution prevention and to request company's assistance, as may be deemed necessary.
- 10.2.3. The Master should ensure that a log of events is maintained, including any type of evidence (i.e. SVDR, photos and video where possible).
- 10.2.4. He is responsible for issuing any message to DPA, Operations Department, coast stations, coast guards, local authorities and ships in the vicinity and is to ensure that no messages are transmitted without his approval.
- 10.2.5. If necessary and in any doubt, he should seek advice from the DPA.
- 10.2.6. Any enquiries from the media should be referred to the Director PFS who will liaise with appropriate Director, SR MARINE Semco or his designate.
- 10.2.7. In the event of the Master not being able to fufil his duties and responsibilities, the next highest ranking officer shall take over the above responsibilities.
- 10.2.8. Nothing in this Manual or any other Company documentation is to be considered as a limitation of the Master's Authority to deal with emergencies.
- 10.2.9. At offshore, the responsibility for vessel emergency response rests with the Master and his operating management. Where a casualty occurs in territorial waters or port limits, the national authority / port authority and/or the client may be involved and the Master's and his operating management's freedom of action may be thereby constrained. This would be particularly so if the hazards relevant to the casualty could put third parties at risk. In these latter circumstances, contingency plans may need to be adapted quickly to take account of the requirements of the shore authorities. However, the basic considerations in these circumstances are still of the same nature as those when the vessel is offshore.

# 10.3. Initial Shipboard Response by Master

- 10.3.1. In an emergency which threatens the lives of the safety of the vessel or the marine environment (including oil spills), the Master must be aware of his responsibilities and actions to be taken to control the situation.
- 10.3.2. The Master's initial orders and the actions of the crew are vital to contain the best use of all resources and to prevent the emergency from escalating. Master's priority actions should take into consideration:
  - V Safety of life at sea;

In fire emergencies involving the engine room, Chief Engineer must ensure remote shut-offs and fuel-oil trips are operated when directed by the Command Team.

{500}------------------------------------------------

#### 10.6 Information Availability

The following information should be readily available to any personnel directly involved with emergency situations:

- V Emergency Response Plan and other relevant manuals
- · Ballast quantity & distribution onboard
- V The location of any hazardous substances
- / General arrangement plan
- Main piping plans
- Safety plan showing locations of life saving and fire fighting equipment
- / List of persons on board
- V Damage control plan

Permanent displays of the location of fire fighting equipment, lifesaving appliances, and Muster List should be in prominent locations throughout the accommodation.

These items, for the benefit of seaboard personnel and shore fire fighting teams, should be kept available in a suitable container located outside the accommodation or near the access point when the vessel is alongside a terminal.

All the above information should be updated whenever a change has been made.

# 10.7 Internal Communication

Whenever an emergency occurs, it is important to have an efficient internal communications between the Command Team, and other teams, the following are typical examples of internal communication systems.

- Telephone
- VHF/UHF Portable Transceiver Radio (Walkie-Talkie)
- V.H.F.
- Talk-Back Systems

Every effort should be made to utilise all systems available during drills so as to familiarise all Seafarers with their use.

It must also be borne in mind that no matter how efficient the communication system is on any particular vessel there will be an occasion when there is a complete communication failure and it will be necessary to rely on messengers using word of mouth. In order that this eventuality is allowed for in the vessel emergency plans, it is recommended that an occasional drill be held where total reliance is placed on messengers for communication purposes.

# 10.8 Initial Actions by Ship's Staff

The person who discovers the emergency must raise the alarm and pass to the Master as much information as possible as to the type and location of the emergency. The Master, in turn will alert the emergency organisation. The persons first identifying the emergency should attempt immediate measures to deal with the emergency until he is relieved by the Emergency Team.

In addition to the vessels fire alarm, the signal should be supplemented by a series of long blasts on the vessels horn/bell, if the vessel is alongside a terminal.

# 10.8.1 Identification of an Emergency

An individual should respond in the following manner on discovering an emergency:

- / Raise the alarm
- Provide the Command Team with as much information as possible.
- If safe, attempt to control the emergency, otherwise retreat to Muster station

{501}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_501_Picture_0.jpeg)

# 10.8.2 Raising the Alarm

![](_page_501_Figure_4.jpeg)

# 10.8.3 Initial Response by on board personnel

b) Instructions for emergency actions

Irrespective of whether the vessel is offshore or in port, on hearing an emergency alarm all the vessels staff should muster at the designated Muster Stations. This ensures that available resources are known and missing persons identified. A maximum state of readiness is promptly established and a standardised response to the emergency is achieved, allowing for co-ordinated and controlled remedial action.

The initial response required from all personnel on hearing the emergency alarm should be:

- ✓ Dress in coverall / long trousers with long sleeves shirt, safety shoes /normal shoes (No sandals, flip flops).
- Collect life jacket and proceed to Muster station

# 10.9 External Communication

External communication tools may include Satellite Phones, where applicable VHF and MF / HF Radio.

Any method of communication may be used when a vessel is in peril. If power supply is available satellite communication may be the most rapid way of establishing contact. At short or medium ranges person to person radio telephone contact may be the most effective. Governments and Coastal State agencies, in many parts of the world, require the use of VHF radiotelephony. If the main and reserved radio equipment is unavailable, effort should be made to relay messages through vessels or shore stations in the vicinity using, for example, battery powered emergency sets

{502}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_502_Picture_0.jpeg)

Reports should be transmitted either:

- to the nearest Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) satellite communication system,
- v if the vessel is not within reach of an MF or VHF coast radio station, to the most appropriate HF coast radio station or relevant maritime satellite communication system; or
- When the vessel is within or near to an area where a vessel movement reporting system has been established, to the designated radio station of that system.

To obtain priority when transmitting messages by radio to stations or vessels within range, the master should use the appropriate prefix signal to indicate that his message concerns distress (MAYDAY), urgency (PANPAN) or safety (SECURITE).

# 10.9.1 Reporting to Shore Authorities

When the vessel is involved in an incident which:

- severely threatens safety of life at sea,
- < severely endangers safety of vessel,
- < involves discharge or threaten discharge of harmful substances resulting from damage to vessel or its equipment,

The Master should report details of the includent without delay to the nearest coastal state by means of the fastest communication channel available to him. In the absence of any prescribed format by the coastal state, the initial report to be sent to the government of the coastal state should be in the format provided in the appendix.

The Master is required to report the incident to the nearest coastal state(s) if any possibility of coastal pollution or danger to navigation exists or the vessel needs assistance,

# 10.9.2 Reporting to the Company

All emergencies must be reported immediately to the company DPA who will alert the Shore Response Team.

# 10.10 Record Keeping

Depending on the circumstances and seriousness of the case, authorities conducting relevant investigation may require testimony/objective evidence of onboard personnel.

Courts of inquiry, legal claims, hearings, may not take place until many months after the event, at which time the Master and some or all of the Seafarers who were on board at the time of the incident may have left the vessel, therefore, it is essential that all facts are accurately recorded at the time of the incident or shortly thereafter, including any type of evidence (i.e. SVDR, photos and video where possible).

Courts of inquiry, legal claims and hearings may not be conducted before some time (possibly several months) have elapsed and, by that time, some of personnel onboard at time of incident may have left particular vessel or company.

Entries in Log Books and other pertinent documents, whether official or not, must be accurate, factual and indisputable. All Log Books and documents are to be completed in ink and in neat and legible writing. Erasures, blanks or other incorrect entries rendered invalid through interference will not be accepted. The only acceptable method is the following:

- a) Rule through the incorrect entry by a single straight line and initial in the margin.
- b) Make the correct entry and initial again.

No entry shall be made by the Seafarers until it has been verified by Master & Chief Engineer respectively. Log Book entries relevant to either actual or suspected damage must always contain the entry "Full extent of damage to vessel: unknown".

# 11. DRILLS AND EXERCISES S 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Proper planning, preparation and training of both shore based personnel and vessel Seafarers are the tools to prevent serious incidents / accidents. Prevention is always preferable to reaction.

Nevertheless the Company must be in a position to respond at any time to hazards, accidents / incidents and emergency situations involving its vessels. In order to achieve that, both vessel and office personnel must be ready to effectively confront adversity.

Emergency preparedness procedures define how the vessel and company identify, describe and respond to potential vessel emergencies.

Vessel's personnel should be familiar with the company procedures for emergencies, their assigned duties, responsibility & authority and the use of related equipment.

Drills and exercises (meaning a simulation, to a degree, of real emergencies) are carried out to:

- Increase the standard and speed of response to potential emergency situations on board.
- Improve Seafarer's awareness of the potential hazards facing themselves and the vessel.
- / Ensure that personnel develop and retain familiarity with the equipment and company procedures.
- Identify Seafarers training needs.
- · Exercising Company's emergency plans including communication and reporting procedures.

#### 11.1. Master is responsible to:

- V Ensure that mandatory and voluntary drills are carried out as required,
- > Ensure that all personnel onboard are familiar with their assigned duties and associated equipment.

# 11.2. Designated Safety Officer is responsible to:

- Monitor participation.
- Carry out proper execution of drills.
- Train subordinates as required.
- Provide feedback to senior management onboard with comments or recommendations.

All Seafarers on board are required to actively participate in drills and exercises and be familiar with their emergency duties & location / operation of LSA / FFA.

Emergency drills should be realistic in nature and endeavor to replicate real life emergency situations, as far as practicable without endangering personnel and vessel.

# 11.3. Attendance

Drills onboard vessel shall be attended by all Seafarers that are not on watch and all passengers.

Upon reporting to stations, as assigned in "Muster List", participants shall be checked off the list of personnel on board. Unjustified non-attendance at drills constitutes grounds for disciplinary action.

# 11.4. Frequency and Planning of Drills and Exercises

Emergency drills and exercises should be carried out at intervals required by international conventions (e.g. SOLAS), and Flag State regulations.

Emergency Drills Planner is provided for guidance and compliance. Drills and exercises shall be properly recorded in Deck Log Book.

Fire and Abandon Ship drills shall take place within 24 hours of the crew arrival at mooring position or port departure, if more than 25% of the Seafarers have not participated in previous abandon

ship and fire drills.

Certain types of drills and exercises relevant to oil pollution are practiced at regular intervals.

In addition to the mandatory drills, emergency drills covering all identified emergencies should be conducted to test the effectiveness and clarity of emergency plans, and to develop the confidence and competence of the personnel who may be involved in actual emergencies.

Planning of drills and exercises is the responsibility of the Master of each vessel. In doing this the Master should consider the particular Seafarer training needs, the nature of the operations carried onboard and client participation.

If a full statutory drill is not held within the appointed time, an entry shall be made in the log-book stating the circumstances and the extent of the muster, drill or training session held.

# 11.5. Unannounced Drills and Exercises

Port State, Administration, company or charterer may request the Masters to participate in unannounced (without prior notice) drill or exercise.

# 11.6. Preparation for Drill and Exercises

Preparation for drills is the responsibility of the designated Safety Officer in co-ordination with the Master.

Preparation is essential for the achievement of the required levels of readiness to respond to emergencies.

The drills should be in line with the Company's emergency response plans in order to convert these plans into practice and check whether they are effective, practical and comprehensible.

The drill scenarios in this manual do not cover every identified emergency situation. The designated Safety Officer should use these scenarios as a framework to prepare for each particular drill.

Prior to a drill the Master should convene with the Bosun and the Chief Engineer, if required, in order to identify any problem which may affect the proper execution of the drill.

# 11.7 Participation of the Company & Third Parties

Where it makes sense, the Company's shore organisation should be integrated into the drill to practice communication and collaboration between vessel and shore. In addition, certain companyinitiated drills to test the Emergency Response Team procedures and train its members shall be carried out. Such drills will be initiated by the DPA.

It is also recommended that third parties (e.g. Charterers, Authorities, Support Vessels) be requested to participate in some of the emergency drills.

The participating Company or third party personnel are to be notified well beforehand.

During an emergency drill, the Vessel Master must exercise the reporting and communication procedures, as laid down in company procedures and in the vessel's SOPEP.

In any communication to external parties, verbal or written, it must be made very clear that it is an exercise and not a real emergency.

# 11.8. Drills and Exercises Review

Following the drill, all participants get together for a review. This review shall take into account following:

- Objectives and expected competency are achieved. -
- Re-evaluate the training needs to suit the crew and job requirements. ii.
- Enable proper feedback on the adequacy of the drill to the Company. iii -

The designated Safety Officer summarises and comments on the effectiveness of the measures. Every participant must have the opportunity and be encouraged to report on bottlenecks and mistakes and to make proposals for improvements.

{505}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_505_Picture_0.jpeg)

These remarks and proposals or suggestions made are recorded by the designated Safety Officer.

The results of the drills are discussed in the next safety meeting the effectiveness of the emergency response plans and the applied drill scenario shall be examined and commented. Weak or possible improvement areas, mistakes made during the drills and any Seafarers training needs should be identified. Minutes of these minutes shall be kept by the designated Safety Officer.

Any proposed modification of an emergency plan is to be recorded by the designated Safety Officer and communicated by the Vessel Master to the DPA.

#### 11.9. Training Needs

The Master shall continually assess professional capabilities of personnel. Those whose professional capabilities could be improved by supplemental training, they should be provided opportunities to learn.

# 11.10. Drills and Exercises Records and Reporting

Records of all emergency drills and exercises conducted on board should be maintained in the deck log book and DRILL REPORT.

Every month, the Master must submit to Head Office, a full list of all emergency drills carried out as per the drill planner.

Company of the contraction of the superior contraction of the superior

# 12. NOTE OF PROTEST

When another vessel or structure has caused, or may have caused, any damage to a company vessel, a "Note of Protest" may be executed,

A Note of protest shall be prepared and processed within 24 hours of Incident. It shall include extracts from Deck Log Book (being an accurate record of all conditions and occurrences experienced).

Notes of Protest shall be noted before appropriate consul or notary public as and when advised by head office.

Original copy acknowledged by the recipient shall be retained on board and copy sent to head office.

#### 12.1. Acceptance of Liability

Should the Company's vessel be involved in a collision with another vessel, the Master, the owner or the agent of the other vessel must be held responsible in writing for all damages and/or losses sustained by the parties having lawful interest in the Company's vessel.

An acknowledgement of receipt of such letter should be obtained. Receipt of a similar letter from another vessel, or from a shore installation involved in the incident should be acknowledged as follows:

# "Signed for receipt only and not as an admission of liability".

When any damage is sustained by or inflicted on another offshore installation, vessel or a shore installation, the Master should ensure, through the agent, that the Master or agent of the other vessel or the representative of the shore installation, as the case may be, is invited to attend the damage survey of his vessel and to agree to the extent of such damage.

Likewise, the Master, through the agent, should ensure that the surveyor acting on behalf of the Company should be present at the damage survey of the other offshore installation, vessel or shore installation.

# 12.2. Restriction of Information

No statement or declaration should be made to any person until advice has been received from the Company, In each and every case that the Master has no option other than to issue or provide a Port or other Authority with a statement or report, on any such statement or report he shall add the following:

# "Submitted without prejudice and not as an admission of liability"

#### Purpose and 1 - 110

- 1.1. SR MARINE Fleet Services Pte. Ltd. has developed this Emergency Response Procedure (ERP) which is applicable to all Company vessels and provides guidance to assist the vessel's Master and operational personnel in dealing with all aspects of emergencies. This ERP Manual contains information to handle an emergency and to take the necessary actions to stop or minimise damage and to mitigate the effects of an emergency.
- 1.2. This ERP also addresses the upward notification and reporting to the Company Senior Management and other relevant Company personnel. The notification and reporting is through the DPA and/or alternate DPA.
- 1.3. This ERP is authorised by the Director SR MARINE Fleet Services (PFS) who authorises the designated DPA to act as the link on matters of safety between the Fleet and senior management.

# 2. Scope Scope I L . Scope 1 1

- 2.1 . This ERP addresses the safeguarding of life & property, the minimisation of environmental impact and ensuring as far as possible the continuous safe operation of the vessel in the event of an onboard emergency.
- 3. Location of Company Shore Based Response Team Coordination Centre and Company

The Shore Response Team Coordination Centre is located at the below-mentioned Shipyard Road address and will be convened in as and when necessary.

# 4. RESPONSIBILITY

- 4.1 an event of an emergency involving a company vessel (or tow), the Master is fully in-charge of all shipboard operations. The Master's priority will focus on the safety of personnel and vessel and to take actions to prevent the escalation of the emergency. Subject to the exigencies of the incident, an immediate initial verbal notification to the DPA (or the alternate DPA) must be initiated at the earliest opportunity (within 30 minutes) in order to enable the DPA to assist the vessel in handling the emergency.
- 4.2. The DPA will inform the senior management including Corporate legal and Insurance Department. This is to ensure that the senior management are appraised of the situation and any advice from Legal and Insurance department is complied with in order to protect the vessel's and the Company's interests.
- 4.3. The ERP is for handling emergency situations using whatever resources and assets that are available. When necessary, DPA will activate the Shore Response Team (SRT). The Shore Commander (Overall in-charge of the SRT) will assess the emergency and determine the response level. Assets from the company and/or third party assets where available and applicable may then be mobilised to assist the distressed vessel depending on the response level and advice from the SRT members.
- 4.4. All company assets will fall under the control of the Shore Commander. External assets such as government vessels may not fall under the control of the Shore Commander but, where possible, a link will be established between the distressed vessel and the non-company assets.
- 4.5 On scene, the Master (or his designated or the designated On-Scene Commander will be fully incharge of the emergency response operation. Where available, all assets will assist the vessel as required.
- 4.6 Where it is necessary for personnel evacuation from a Company vessel at sea, refer to the International Aeronautical Martime Search and Rescue (IAMSAR) Manual for guidance in coordination with Maritime Rescue assets and Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC).

# 5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE LEVELS

- 5.1. The ERP uses the concept of tiered response. The response level is divided into 3 levels of response, (level 1, 2, and 3) to classify the severity of the emergency. These response levels also provide an indication to the resources to be mobilised and deployed. However, this is subject to the availability of assets from within the company and external parties' involvement.
- 5.2. The following response levels would be used to determine the severity of the emergency and the resources to be mobilised and deployed :

Level 1: This is for an emergency where the situation is controllable and can be managed effectively by utilising the vessel's own capability and on-board resources.

Level2: This requires a combination of the vessel's own capability and the support of additional company assets, where available. At this level, the emergency may have serious consequences to lives, property, environment and assets. The situation may be contained by company assets or sub-contracted on-site resources.

Level3: This response requires a full turn-out of all resources: from own vessel, support of additional company assets (if available) and the involvement of third parties and government response organisations. In this level, the emergency is threatening to affect or has affected lives, environment or assets that may warrant evacuation of the crew.

# 6. COMMUNICATION & REPORTING

6.1. In'all emergencies, the DPA MUST be informed and all emails must be copied to the appropriate Operations Department Superintendent and the and the HSEQA email group (hseq@paccoffshore.com.sg) so that the senior management are fully informed of developments.

![](_page_511_Figure_5.jpeg)

6.2. Emergency Contact List: Every vessel will be provided, thru circular, with latest Emergency Contact List from office, which will be amended as and when changes take place. The Master shall clearly display the emergency contact list on the bridge with a copy also displayed in the Engine room.

The Emergency Contact List will also be available in the Shore Response Team Coordination Centre.

As and when applicable, Vessel with Charter's emergency contact list for the current project, which shall be clearly displayed on bridge next to the SR MARINE contact list.

- 6.3. The DPA (or his designate) will be the key person ashore in handling the response operation. If necessary, he will communicate directly to and from the vessel, although keeping the appropriate Divisional Director, SR MARINE Semco informed. Where vessels are involved in project work where there is a Project ERP, the DPA will also work in liaison with the Project Director or his designate.
- 6.4. The Initial notification Checklist will be initially used in disseminating of information from the vessel to the SRT. This will provide the essential information that is required for SRT to work out a suitable plan to assist the vessel.
- 6.5. Communication with External Parties (other than media): If the nature of the emergency involves external government agencies or other assisting vessels rendering assistance to the vessel, the on-scene Commander should establish communications with the external parties.

# 7. CRISIS MANAGEMENT

7.1 Communication with the Media: Depending on the nature of the emergency, it may potentially generate great interest with the general public. Contacts with the media are the responsibility of the Director PFS (or designate) in consultation with the SR MARINE Semco Divisional Director. If necessary, a Team of Company Management Personnel will be convened to address media issues, including press releases, press conferences etc. This Team may include but not be limited to appropriate representation from PFS and SR MARINE Semco.

#### 7.2 Responding to the Media

# a. Preparation of Policy Statements

When preparing policy statements, the following general principles should be considered :

- · When responding to a crisis situation, the response should be honest, timely and direct. Having a prepared, approved and distributed policy statement will help to resist the temptation to say "no comment" which may result in the company appearing to be uncooperative or secretive during a crisis situation.
- · Do the right thing, being fair to all parties to the best of your ability.

# b. Preparing Specific Responses (such as Press Releases)

After a crisis scenario has been identified, specific responses should be prepared,

Consider the following checklist when drafting press releases :

- · Define the scope of the crisis local, regional, national or international,
- · Establish a unified response one spokesperson established to distribute statements to the media, etc.
- · Keep the message simple, clear, consistent and tailored to each audience.

Understand that the media wants primarily to know three things :

- what happened? .
- . why did it happen?
- · what are you going to do to make sure that it never happens again?

In addition to the policy statements & press releases, anticipate media questions that may be asked.

List the questions with developed answers that the crisis team is comfortable with and continually update the list as new questions are identified. Team members should have immediate access to each other at all times in the event of a crisis.

Finally, the news media must be briefed on a regular basis. All phone calls from the media must be answered quickly and completely. Keep media logs listing the date and time, source, reporter, phone number and the questions asked.

Stick to your core message and deliver that message to everyone. Bear in mind that Social Media issues may also need to be similarly addressed.

# c. Post - Crisis Review

The crisis management process does not end once a crisis has occurred and been resolved.

Each situation should be carefully evaluated in terms of:

- the media coverage received .
- · the resulting image of the Company
- · the development of short and long term programmes to rebuild image
- · reviewing position statements for relevance and necessary revisions.

# 8. EXTERNAL SUPPORT SERVICES

#### 8.1 Medical Support

In addition to the standard Radio medico advice available through GMDSS, SR MARINE has a contracted support arrangement with shore-based Healthcare Service Providers in Singapore to provide medical support to all its employees, both shore-based and seagoing,

The services provided include real-time medical advice whereby the Master of a vessel can correspond or even speak directly with the Duty Medical Practitioner, especially in urgent cases of injury or illness where delay could cause further deterioration in a patient's condition.

Regular contact is maintained between the Crewing Department and the shore-based Healthcare Service Providers in Singapore to ensure the contacts remain current.

#### 8.2 Emergency Exercises

A table top exercise between Shore and Ship shall be conducted at least once a year to ensure adequate response at any time to hazards, accidents and emergency situations on board ships.

Such exercises may involve external parties (e.g. Port State, Flag State) and, on completion of the table top drill, an analysis shall be conducted and respective flag state forms completed if so required.

The exercise will be coordinated at the head office by SRT with a designated vessel.

# 10. SHIPBOARD EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES

#### 10.1. General

10.1.1. The Master and OOW must be fully conversant with the emergency checklist and should know what initial action to take in response to emergencies. See all the emergency checklists contained in the Appendices.

#### Master Responsibility 10.2.

- 10.2.1, The Master is ultimately responsible for his crew, vessel and towltows at all times and in the event of an accident, he is in charge of the seaborne operation.
- 10.2.2. The Master has overriding authority and responsibility to make decisions, with respect to safety and pollution prevention and to request company's assistance, as may be deemed necessary.
- 10.2.3. The Master should ensure that a log of events is maintained, including any type of evidence (i.e. SVDR, photos and video where possible).
- 10.2.4. He is responsible for issuing any message to DPA, Operations Department, coast stations, coast guards, local authorities and ships in the vicinity and is to ensure that no messages are transmitted without his approval.
- 10.2.5. If necessary and in any doubt, he should seek advice from the DPA.
- 10.2.6. Any enquiries from the media should be referred to the Director PFS who will liaise with appropriate Director, SR MARINE Semco or his designate.
- 10.2.7. In the event of the Master not being able to fufil his duties and responsibilities, the next highest ranking officer shall take over the above responsibilities.
- 10.2.8. Nothing in this Manual or any other Company documentation is to be considered as a limitation of the Master's Authority to deal with emergencies.
- 10.2.9. At offshore, the responsibility for vessel emergency response rests with the Master and his operating management. Where a casualty occurs in territorial waters or port limits, the national authority / port authority and/or the client may be involved and the Master's and his operating management's freedom of action may be thereby constrained. This would be particularly so if the hazards relevant to the casualty could put third parties at risk. In these latter circumstances, contingency plans may need to be adapted quickly to take account of the requirements of the shore authorities. However, the basic considerations in these circumstances are still of the same nature as those when the vessel is offshore.

# 10.3. Initial Shipboard Response by Master

- 10.3.1. In an emergency which threatens the lives of the safety of the vessel or the marine environment (including oil spills), the Master must be aware of his responsibilities and actions to be taken to control the situation.
- 10.3.2. The Master's initial orders and the actions of the crew are vital to contain the best use of all resources and to prevent the emergency from escalating. Master's priority actions should take into consideration:
  - V Safety of life at sea;

{523}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_523_Picture_0.jpeg)

10.5.2 Emergency Teams: On board organisation may consist (where practicable) of five teams :

#### Command Team 1.

Command Team controls communications and the emergency organisation; it is directly responsible for taking mitigating action during emergency. The command centre should have means of internal and external communication, though it is preferable to have bridge as command team location but it may vary depending on nature of emergency. The Command team is headed by the Master.

#### 2. Emergency Team 1

This should be under the command of the Chief officer! Deck / Safety Officer and should assess the situation and report to the command centre, advising what action should be taken and what assistance should be provided.

#### Emergency Team 2 3.

At all times stand by to assist the emergency squad as instructed by the command centre and provide back-up services & equipment as well as preparing life-saving and fire-fighting equipment

# 4. Engine Control Room Team

This team should be under the command of the Chief Engineer and should provide emergency assistance as instructed by the command centre.

#### 5. First Aid Team

This team shall at all times on standby with stretcher and first aid kits to attend the casualties, if any, keeping the command centre informed of the condition of casualties and responsible for providing first aid treatment.

# 10.5.3 Duties of Emergency Organisation S

The Command Team is responsible for command and control of the emergency situation and for ensuring an efficient muster of personnel. They will institute search for any person not accounted for. The Command Team will establish internal and external communications,

On hearing the alarm, the Command Team will muster location (as allocated). The Master should direct the Emergency Teams to provide information relating to the emergency. The Master will assess the situation from the reports received from team leaders. The information received and directions given by the Master must be timed and recorded.

The Master will direct the Emergency Teams, on specific action to be taken. In emergencies relating to machineries, and the machinery space itself Emergency Team 2 will spearhead the emergency response actions, under the direction of the Master, and Emergency Team 1 will provide back-up. In all other emergency situations, Emergency Team 1 will be spearhead team and Emergency Team 2 will be the back-up team.

To assist the Master to formulate an action plan to tackle the emergency at hand, this manual provides handy check-lists for various emergencies.

The Emergency Teams must first muster and report to Command Team. They should prepare equipment as ordered and report readiness. The emergency team shall take all necessary steps to control the emergency under the orders of the Command Team.

The Engine Control room team should muster at a designated location and advise their readiness to the Command Team. They should also provide logistic support to the Emergency Teams, when ordered.

The Chief Engineer must advise the Master of the state of readiness of machineries needed to tackle the emergency. The Chief Engineer should establish whether the emergency has any adverse effect on the operation of the plant, and determine any action to be taken to reduce illeffects. The team should maintain essential emergency services and attend to fixed fire-fighting appliances as necessary. In fire emergencies involving the engine room, Chief Engineer must ensure remote shut-offs and fuel-oil trips are operated when directed by the Command Team.

{524}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_524_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### 10.6 Information Availability

The following information should be readily available to any personnel directly involved with emergency situations:

- V Emergency Response Plan and other relevant manuals
- · Ballast quantity & distribution onboard
- V The location of any hazardous substances
- / General arrangement plan
- Main piping plans
- Safety plan showing locations of life saving and fire fighting equipment
- / List of persons on board
- V Damage control plan

Permanent displays of the location of fire fighting equipment, lifesaving appliances, and Muster List should be in prominent locations throughout the accommodation.

These items, for the benefit of seaboard personnel and shore fire fighting teams, should be kept available in a suitable container located outside the accommodation or near the access point when the vessel is alongside a terminal.

All the above information should be updated whenever a change has been made.

# 10.7 Internal Communication

Whenever an emergency occurs, it is important to have an efficient internal communications between the Command Team, and other teams, the following are typical examples of internal communication systems.

- Telephone
- VHF/UHF Portable Transceiver Radio (Walkie-Talkie)
- V.H.F.
- Talk-Back Systems

Every effort should be made to utilise all systems available during drills so as to familiarise all Seafarers with their use.

It must also be borne in mind that no matter how efficient the communication system is on any particular vessel there will be an occasion when there is a complete communication failure and it will be necessary to rely on messengers using word of mouth. In order that this eventuality is allowed for in the vessel emergency plans, it is recommended that an occasional drill be held where total reliance is placed on messengers for communication purposes.

# 10.8 Initial Actions by Ship's Staff

The person who discovers the emergency must raise the alarm and pass to the Master as much information as possible as to the type and location of the emergency. The Master, in turn will alert the emergency organisation. The persons first identifying the emergency should attempt immediate measures to deal with the emergency until he is relieved by the Emergency Team.

In addition to the vessels fire alarm, the signal should be supplemented by a series of long blasts on the vessels horn/bell, if the vessel is alongside a terminal.

# 10.8.1 Identification of an Emergency

An individual should respond in the following manner on discovering an emergency:

- / Raise the alarm
- Provide the Command Team with as much information as possible.
- If safe, attempt to control the emergency, otherwise retreat to Muster station

{525}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_525_Picture_0.jpeg)

# 10.8.2 Raising the Alarm

![](_page_525_Figure_4.jpeg)

# 10.8.3 Initial Response by on board personnel

b) Instructions for emergency actions

Irrespective of whether the vessel is offshore or in port, on hearing an emergency alarm all the vessels staff should muster at the designated Muster Stations. This ensures that available resources are known and missing persons identified. A maximum state of readiness is promptly established and a standardised response to the emergency is achieved, allowing for co-ordinated and controlled remedial action.

The initial response required from all personnel on hearing the emergency alarm should be:

- ✓ Dress in coverall / long trousers with long sleeves shirt, safety shoes /normal shoes (No sandals, flip flops).
- Collect life jacket and proceed to Muster station

# 10.9 External Communication

External communication tools may include Satellite Phones, where applicable VHF and MF / HF Radio.

Any method of communication may be used when a vessel is in peril. If power supply is available satellite communication may be the most rapid way of establishing contact. At short or medium ranges person to person radio telephone contact may be the most effective. Governments and Coastal State agencies, in many parts of the world, require the use of VHF radiotelephony. If the main and reserved radio equipment is unavailable, effort should be made to relay messages through vessels or shore stations in the vicinity using, for example, battery powered emergency sets

{526}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_526_Picture_0.jpeg)

Reports should be transmitted either:

- to the nearest Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) satellite communication system,
- v if the vessel is not within reach of an MF or VHF coast radio station, to the most appropriate HF coast radio station or relevant maritime satellite communication system; or
- When the vessel is within or near to an area where a vessel movement reporting system has been established, to the designated radio station of that system.

To obtain priority when transmitting messages by radio to stations or vessels within range, the master should use the appropriate prefix signal to indicate that his message concerns distress (MAYDAY), urgency (PANPAN) or safety (SECURITE).

# 10.9.1 Reporting to Shore Authorities

When the vessel is involved in an incident which:

- severely threatens safety of life at sea,
- < severely endangers safety of vessel,
- < involves discharge or threaten discharge of harmful substances resulting from damage to vessel or its equipment,

The Master should report details of the includent without delay to the nearest coastal state by means of the fastest communication channel available to him. In the absence of any prescribed format by the coastal state, the initial report to be sent to the government of the coastal state should be in the format provided in the appendix.

The Master is required to report the incident to the nearest coastal state(s) if any possibility of coastal pollution or danger to navigation exists or the vessel needs assistance,

# 10.9.2 Reporting to the Company

All emergencies must be reported immediately to the company DPA who will alert the Shore Response Team.

# 10.10 Record Keeping

Depending on the circumstances and seriousness of the case, authorities conducting relevant investigation may require testimony/objective evidence of onboard personnel.

Courts of inquiry, legal claims, hearings, may not take place until many months after the event, at which time the Master and some or all of the Seafarers who were on board at the time of the incident may have left the vessel, therefore, it is essential that all facts are accurately recorded at the time of the incident or shortly thereafter, including any type of evidence (i.e. SVDR, photos and video where possible).

Courts of inquiry, legal claims and hearings may not be conducted before some time (possibly several months) have elapsed and, by that time, some of personnel onboard at time of incident may have left particular vessel or company.

Entries in Log Books and other pertinent documents, whether official or not, must be accurate, factual and indisputable. All Log Books and documents are to be completed in ink and in neat and legible writing. Erasures, blanks or other incorrect entries rendered invalid through interference will not be accepted. The only acceptable method is the following:

- a) Rule through the incorrect entry by a single straight line and initial in the margin.
- b) Make the correct entry and initial again.

No entry shall be made by the Seafarers until it has been verified by Master & Chief Engineer respectively. Log Book entries relevant to either actual or suspected damage must always contain the entry "Full extent of damage to vessel: unknown".

# 11. DRILLS AND EXERCISES S 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Proper planning, preparation and training of both shore based personnel and vessel Seafarers are the tools to prevent serious incidents / accidents. Prevention is always preferable to reaction.

Nevertheless the Company must be in a position to respond at any time to hazards, accidents / incidents and emergency situations involving its vessels. In order to achieve that, both vessel and office personnel must be ready to effectively confront adversity.

Emergency preparedness procedures define how the vessel and company identify, describe and respond to potential vessel emergencies.

Vessel's personnel should be familiar with the company procedures for emergencies, their assigned duties, responsibility & authority and the use of related equipment.

Drills and exercises (meaning a simulation, to a degree, of real emergencies) are carried out to:

- Increase the standard and speed of response to potential emergency situations on board.
- Improve Seafarer's awareness of the potential hazards facing themselves and the vessel.
- / Ensure that personnel develop and retain familiarity with the equipment and company procedures.
- Identify Seafarers training needs.
- · Exercising Company's emergency plans including communication and reporting procedures.

- Carry out proper execution of drills.
- Train subordinates as required.
- Provide feedback to senior management onboard with comments or recommendations.

All Seafarers on board are required to actively participate in drills and exercises and be familiar with their emergency duties & location / operation of LSA / FFA.

Emergency drills should be realistic in nature and endeavor to replicate real life emergency situations, as far as practicable without endangering personnel and vessel.

# 11.3. Attendance

Drills onboard vessel shall be attended by all Seafarers that are not on watch and all passengers.

Upon reporting to stations, as assigned in "Muster List", participants shall be checked off the list of personnel on board. Unjustified non-attendance at drills constitutes grounds for disciplinary action.

# 11.4. Frequency and Planning of Drills and Exercises

Emergency drills and exercises should be carried out at intervals required by international conventions (e.g. SOLAS), and Flag State regulations.

Emergency Drills Planner is provided for guidance and compliance. Drills and exercises shall be properly recorded in Deck Log Book.

Fire and Abandon Ship drills shall take place within 24 hours of the crew arrival at mooring position or port departure, if more than 25% of the Seafarers have not participated in previous abandon

ship and fire drills.

Certain types of drills and exercises relevant to oil pollution are practiced at regular intervals.

In addition to the mandatory drills, emergency drills covering all identified emergencies should be conducted to test the effectiveness and clarity of emergency plans, and to develop the confidence and competence of the personnel who may be involved in actual emergencies.

Planning of drills and exercises is the responsibility of the Master of each vessel. In doing this the Master should consider the particular Seafarer training needs, the nature of the operations carried onboard and client participation.

If a full statutory drill is not held within the appointed time, an entry shall be made in the log-book stating the circumstances and the extent of the muster, drill or training session held.

# 11.5. Unannounced Drills and Exercises

Port State, Administration, company or charterer may request the Masters to participate in unannounced (without prior notice) drill or exercise.

# 11.6. Preparation for Drill and Exercises

Preparation for drills is the responsibility of the designated Safety Officer in co-ordination with the Master.

Preparation is essential for the achievement of the required levels of readiness to respond to emergencies.

The drills should be in line with the Company's emergency response plans in order to convert these plans into practice and check whether they are effective, practical and comprehensible.

The drill scenarios in this manual do not cover every identified emergency situation. The designated Safety Officer should use these scenarios as a framework to prepare for each particular drill.

Prior to a drill the Master should convene with the Bosun and the Chief Engineer, if required, in order to identify any problem which may affect the proper execution of the drill.

# 11.7 Participation of the Company & Third Parties

Where it makes sense, the Company's shore organisation should be integrated into the drill to practice communication and collaboration between vessel and shore. In addition, certain companyinitiated drills to test the Emergency Response Team procedures and train its members shall be carried out. Such drills will be initiated by the DPA.

It is also recommended that third parties (e.g. Charterers, Authorities, Support Vessels) be requested to participate in some of the emergency drills.

The participating Company or third party personnel are to be notified well beforehand.

During an emergency drill, the Vessel Master must exercise the reporting and communication procedures, as laid down in company procedures and in the vessel's SOPEP.

In any communication to external parties, verbal or written, it must be made very clear that it is an exercise and not a real emergency.

# 11.8. Drills and Exercises Review

Following the drill, all participants get together for a review. This review shall take into account following:

- Objectives and expected competency are achieved. -
- Re-evaluate the training needs to suit the crew and job requirements. ii.
- Enable proper feedback on the adequacy of the drill to the Company. iii -

The designated Safety Officer summarises and comments on the effectiveness of the measures. Every participant must have the opportunity and be encouraged to report on bottlenecks and mistakes and to make proposals for improvements.

{529}------------------------------------------------

These remarks and proposals or suggestions made are recorded by the designated Safety Officer.

The results of the drills are discussed in the next safety meeting the effectiveness of the emergency response plans and the applied drill scenario shall be examined and commented. Weak or possible improvement areas, mistakes made during the drills and any Seafarers training needs should be identified. Minutes of these minutes shall be kept by the designated Safety Officer.

Any proposed modification of an emergency plan is to be recorded by the designated Safety Officer and communicated by the Vessel Master to the DPA.

#### 11.9. Training Needs

The Master shall continually assess professional capabilities of personnel. Those whose professional capabilities could be improved by supplemental training, they should be provided opportunities to learn.

# 11.10. Drills and Exercises Records and Reporting

Records of all emergency drills and exercises conducted on board should be maintained in the deck log book and DRILL REPORT.

Every month, the Master must submit to Head Office, a full list of all emergency drills carried out as per the drill planner.

# 12. NOTE OF PROTEST

When another vessel or structure has caused, or may have caused, any damage to a company vessel, a "Note of Protest" may be executed,

A Note of protest shall be prepared and processed within 24 hours of Incident. It shall include extracts from Deck Log Book (being an accurate record of all conditions and occurrences experienced).

Notes of Protest shall be noted before appropriate consul or notary public as and when advised by head office.

Original copy acknowledged by the recipient shall be retained on board and copy sent to head office.

#### 12.1. Acceptance of Liability

Should the Company's vessel be involved in a collision with another vessel, the Master, the owner or the agent of the other vessel must be held responsible in writing for all damages and/or losses sustained by the parties having lawful interest in the Company's vessel.

An acknowledgement of receipt of such letter should be obtained. Receipt of a similar letter from another vessel, or from a shore installation involved in the incident should be acknowledged as follows:

# "Signed for receipt only and not as an admission of liability".

When any damage is sustained by or inflicted on another offshore installation, vessel or a shore installation, the Master should ensure, through the agent, that the Master or agent of the other vessel or the representative of the shore installation, as the case may be, is invited to attend the damage survey of his vessel and to agree to the extent of such damage.

Likewise, the Master, through the agent, should ensure that the surveyor acting on behalf of the Company should be present at the damage survey of the other offshore installation, vessel or shore installation.

# 12.2. Restriction of Information

No statement or declaration should be made to any person until advice has been received from the Company, In each and every case that the Master has no option other than to issue or provide a Port or other Authority with a statement or report, on any such statement or report he shall add the following:

# "Submitted without prejudice and not as an admission of liability"

#### 1.0 MEDEVAC

MEDEVAC is the Medical Evacuation for serious medical cases only in life and death situation or to reduce the impact of serious damage that might occur to a person due to either illness or injury, especially those where a risk for life or limb is emphasised and not for normal medical cases.

The Master shall carry out an assessment and the first aid treatment on the spot of accident. Based on initial assessment, he should evaluate situation and the decision to transport the patient to the nearest hospital or medical facility (offshore installation) to stabilise his condition and further evacuation, if so required, to the hospital with full medical care facilities.

The requirement of Medical evacuation of a casualty or ill person whether work related or nonwork related will be decided by the Client's doctor / medic on-board, contracted shore based medical support, DPA and the Master.

In situations where there is no Medic support available (either on board or by client), Master shall take the advice of contracted Medical support based in Singapore.

Where the client has their own Medevac procedures, the information must be readily available on the Bridge.

Following means (as and when available) shall be considered for MEDEVAC:

- a. by boat (or own fast rasque craft) transfer to shore or offshore installation, or transfer of doctor to own vessel.
- b. Ship to ship transfer of casualty where medical facility is available1,
- c. Helicopter transfer to shore or offshore installation (refer to Volume III, International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue (IAMSAR) Manual).
- d. Personnel basket / capsule transfer to Offshore Installation (refer to IMS 16 Section 13),

#### 2.0 REPORTING

Serious injury or fatality of any person onboard shall be immediately reported to Company and client to ensure immediate attention; the Master must provide full details of injury/illness to all parties for good evaluation of prevailing emergency.

A full report covering the circumstances is to be sent to the Company at the first available opportunity.

A decision to land a sick or injured person should be based on sound medical advice and supported by a medical report from the Medic / Doctor on board / Doctor ashore,

When there is no other facility or support available, the Master shall contact the nearest coast guard / coastal radio station for MEDEVAC, in co-ordination with the Company and local agents.

While the vessel is in port and faced with a medical emergency (illness or injury) the Master must use all available mean at his disposal to inform the Company, Agent and Port Authority so that immediate medical attention can be provided or if required, the injured person can be evacuated. To the above effect, Master must maintain an updated Emergency Contact Numbers for various ports of call example Ambulance, Fire Brigade, Police etc.

# 1. Properties of H2S

Sulphur is present in natural gas and crude oil as hydrogen sulphide (H2S) or as elemental sulphur. Each gas and crude oil has different amounts and types of sulphur compounds, but as a rule the proportion, stability and complexity of the compounds are greater in heavier crude oil fractions.

Crude oils and natural gases which contain appreciable quantities of hydrogen sulphide or other reactive sulphur compounds are usually called "sour", whereas those with less sulphur are usually called "sweet."

Hydrogen sulfide is colorless, transparent, and flammable, smells like "rotten eggs" at very low concentrations, and is denser than air and thus may accumulate in low places. The slightest presence of H2S in the air is normally detectable by its characteristic "rotten-egg" odor; however, it is dangerous to rely on odour as a means of detecting life-threatening concentrations because the sense of smell is lost rapidly, allowing lethal concentrations to accumulate without warning.

H₂S goes to the lungs and in to the blood stream. Higher doses of H₂S will weaken the body's defence system, which causes the H2S to settle in the blood, and the individual becomes poisoned.

H S is the combination of hydrogen and sulphur atoms. The process of combination takes place by a bio-chemical reaction, the decay, rotting down or putrefaction of dead organic material.

| Chemical symbol :      | H2S                                                    |

| Specific Gravity :     | 1.192 (heavier than air)                               |
| Explosive limits :     | Lower: 4%, Upper: 44% volume in air                    |
| Ignition Temperature : | 500 F (260 °C)                                         |
| Solubility in water :  | 2.9 volumes of gas, per volume of water at 20°C (68 F) |

- b) Nerve center in the brain paralyzed.
- Breathing Stops. c)
- d) Unconsciousness (Possible death if not rescued)

# 5. Safety Procedures

- a) Be on alert for possible detection of H2S gas,
- b) Listen for announcements (onboard and/or from the installation), voice horn, or otherwise watch visible warning system.
- c) Know location of H2S Muster point.
- d) Know location of protective breathing apparatus (SCBA)
- e) Inform your working partner (buddy) of an alert or an emergency condition.
- f) Do not panic. Remain calm and follow instructions.
- g) Familiarise yourself with nearest escape route for possible evacuation,
- h) Do not enter a suspicious area without a mask until the concentration of H2S has been checked.
- i) If an odour of H2S ('rotten agg smell') is detected while wearing a mask, go out of the contaminated area. Check the mask for leaks.
- i) Be conscious of the wind direction at all times. Crew shall move quickly and cautiously to a location upwind and away from potential H2S sources.
- k) Manoeuvre the vessel upwind from the H2S source.
- I) Close all external doors, hatches and portholes and consider closing vent flaps.

# 6. Emergency situation without Escape sets:

If H2S gas is detected by Odour (rotten eggs) or by personal gas detector (10 ppm) when vessel is in immediate proximity of an offshore installation or rig or alongside to any of these:

- a) Do not panic.
- b) Hold your breath.
- Check wind direction. C)
- d) Escape upwind or cross wind.
- e) Do not assist any person under H2S attack unless properly equipped.
- f) Proceed to Muster Station H2S (Level 5) and call for help (inform bridge).

# 7. Upon hearing the H2S alert:

- a) Ring alarm and announce via the PA system
- b) Call Master if not on bridge.
- c) All personnel to proceed immediately to Muster Station.
- d) Duty Engineer to stop all vessel's fans, air intakes and A/C.

{570}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_570_Picture_0.jpeg)

- h) Master/Company Man alerts all parties concerned in regards to Medical Evacuation or down manning if necessary.
- i) On Accommodation vessel at anchor, winch operators to remain stand by on the bridge for shifting away from location.
- Master to inform the DPA. D

# 8. First Aid for victims of H2S:

- 8.1 It is very important that help and treatment in case of accidents are affected immediately. In order to minimise the risk of exposure, it is important to remember the following:
  - Most important to the victim is fresh air or oxygen, quickly! Get the person out of the a. dangerous area, but remember to protect yourself first. Buddy system must be employed.
  - b. You cannot define the concentration of H2S as even low concentrations kill the sense of smell.
  - c. Wearing breathing equipment (self-contained breathing apparatus) when resouing a person in an area contaminated of H2S. Do not try to rescue without an SCBA.
- 8.2 The following first aid procedure will apply if a person should overcome by H2S:
  - a. H2S absorbed in the body soxidised fairly quickly whereby the acute effect on the breathing organs ceases
  - b. Therefore, it is important to remove the victim from the contaminated area to fresh air. Remember to walk into the wind with the victim if possible, rather than across the wind direction.
- 8.3 If the victim is unconscious, use the following means as appropriate:
  - a. Remove the victim from the affected area. If a person must be pulled or dragged to a safe breathing area, pull by the shoulders.
  - b. If the victim is unconscious after reaching the safe breathing area, the breathing is to be checked immediately and, in case of suspended respiration, artificial resuscitation should be administered immediately.
  - At the first opportunity, replace Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) efforts with C. oxygen resuscitators.
  - Continue to administer oxygen when the person begins breathing.
  - e. Treat patient for shock after reviving and keep under constant observation.
  - f. The person is to be immediately evacuated to hospital(Medevac).
